      "['No Synopsis', 'No Synopsis', \"In Italy during the the Great War, the carpenter Geppetto loses his son Carlo during an inadvertent aerial bomb. Geppetto honors his memory by planting a pine cone near his grave and spends the next twenty years mourning his loss. An anthropomorphic cricket named Sebastian takes up residence in the resulting pine tree. Geppetto subsequently cuts down the tree in a fit of drunken rage in order to make a new son out of its wood. He passes out drunk, leaving the puppet unfinished, and a bluish Wood Sprite brings it to life, christening him Pinocchio. The Sprite meets Sebastian and promises to grant him a wish, which he intends to use in order to become famous, in exchange for acting as Pinocchio's guide.\\n\\nGeppetto later discovers that Pinocchio is alive and locks him in a closet while he goes to church, but Pinocchio follows him and frightens the villagers. The next day, he sends Pinocchio to school, but the puppet is intercepted by the former aristocrat-turned-showman Count Volpe and his performing monkey Spazzatura. Volpe convices Pinocchio to join his circus and gets him to sign a contract. After Geppetto arrives to bring Pinocchio home, he and Volpe have a tug-of-war that results in Pinocchio being thrown to the road where he is hit by a car.\\n\\nPinocchio is sent to the afterlife where he meets Death, the sister of the Wood Sprite. She explains to Pinocchio that he is immortal and that he will return to the mortal realm once an hourglass has flowed, cautioning that the time he spends in the afterlife will increase each time he returns. Returning to the mortal realm, Pinocchio decides to join Volpe's circus, both to earn cash for Geppetto and to avoid being drafted into the Royal Italian Army by the strict Podestà. When Sebastian and Geppetto search for him at sea, they are swallowed by a giant Dogfish. During one of his performances, Pinocchio sings a toilet-humour ladened parody of a previous patriotic song to Prime Minister Benito Mussolini as revenge for Volpe's abuse and is shot, dying once more. He is again revived, but is taken by the Podestà to a training camp where other small boys train themselves to fight in the war. Pinocchio befriends the Podestà's son, Candlewick, who is scared of disappointing his father and being seen as weak. On Pinocchio's advice, Candlewick stands up to his father but the training camp gets bombed, killing the Podestà.\\n\\nPinocchio manages to escape and is captured by Volpe, wanting revenge against the puppet for humiliating him earlier, but Spazzatura intervenes and they are sent over a cliff, with Volpe meeting his demise. When Pinocchio rescues Spazzatura, they are swallowed by the Dogfish, where they soon reunite with Geppetto and Sebastian. Pinocchio tells some lies to make his nose grow in order to make a bridge leading out of the Dogfish's blowhole. Just as they escape, the Dogfish tries to eat them again, forcing Pinocchio to sacrifice himself by detonating a naval mine. Upon meeting Death again, he demands to be sent back early so that he can save Gepetto from drowning, despite the fact that this will result in his death. After rescuing Gepetto, Pinocchio dies, prompting Sebastian to use his wish to make Pinocchio come back.\\n\\nHowever, as Death told Pinocchio, he manages to outlive all of his loved ones as Geppetto, Sebastian and Spazzatura are shown to have died and Pinocchio decides to travel off to parts unknown for new life adventures until the day his time is up.\", 'No Synopsis', 'This animated film starts with Peter Parker (voice of Chris Pine) introducing himself as we know him, the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. By now, everybody knows how big he is, what with saving New York constantly, getting his own comics, cereal, and even a Christmas album. He does have some things he\\'s not proud of (the emo dance, for one), but he takes his duties as Spidey proudly, as he is the one and only.\\n\\nWe meet Brooklyn teen Miles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) as he is getting ready to start attending a private school. He lives with his father Jefferson (voice of Brian Tyree Henry) and his mother Rio (voice of Luna Lauren Velez). Miles goes around his neighborhood greeting his friends and tagging street signs with stickers he made. Jefferson, a cop, catches Miles and escorts him to school in his cruiser. As they ride to the school, they see a news report on Spider-Man, whom Jeff is not a fan of. Once they arrive, Jeff tells Miles he loves him, but Miles fails to say it back. Jeff then uses his radio to force Miles in front of all the other students to say \"I love you\" back, embarrassing him.\\n\\nMiles gets into his schoolwork as he tries to adjust to this new environment. During one of his classes, he meets Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld), who doesn\\'t immediately tell him who she is. Later, Miles sneaks out of his dorm to visit his Uncle Aaron (voice of Mahershala Ali), who is Jefferson\\'s brother and a sort of black sheep due to his criminal activities. Miles tells him about Gwen, and Aaron tells him to do a shoulder touch to try and charm her. The two then go to the tunnels near the subway so that they can do some graffiti since Aaron is fond of Miles\\'s artwork. As Miles spray-paints the walls, a radioactive glitching spider crawls up his leg and bites his hand after Miles takes a picture of his work, but he only lightly taps the spider off his hand before leaving with Aaron.\\n\\nThe next day, Miles finds himself feeling differently. He hears a voice in his head (which is accompanied by comics-style text boxes), his clothes barely fit, and he is sweating profusely. He runs into Gwen, who tries to make up a fake name when they properly introduce themselves. Miles tries to do the shoulder touch, but he only gets his hand stuck on Gwen\\'s shoulder, and then her hair, leading them to have to go to the nurse for her to cut her hair off. When Miles tries going back to his room, he is found by a security guard who calls him out for leaving his dorm. Miles runs and hides in the man\\'s office, getting everything stuck to him as he keeps freaking out. He climbs out the window and finds himself walking on the walls before running into the streets, amazed by his newfound powers and abilities.\\n\\nMiles later goes to the tunnel where the spider bit him. As he examines it, it starts glitching again. Not long after, Miles hides as his spider-sense detects danger. Spider-Man enters as he\\'s being pursued by the Green Goblin (voice of Jorma Taccone). The fight takes them beneath Fisk Industries where Wilson Fisk/Kingpin (voice of Liev Schreiber) is attempting to start up a Super Collider. In the middle of Spidey fighting Goblin, he takes the time to get Miles out of harm\\'s way. Spidey realizes Miles is just like him, just as the machine is turned on. Outside in the city, certain structures start to get weirdly morphed into other shapes. A blast occurs in the tunnel. Spidey is badly injured, and Miles tries to help him, but Spidey tells him to hide before giving him a drive to shut down the Collider. Kingpin, Goblin, and another villain, The Prowler, gather around Spidey and remove his mask. He begs Kingpin not to restart the Collider, even telling him to think about his family, but this angers Kingpin and he kills Spider-Man by slamming his fists down onto him, which Miles watches in horror. He runs back home where his parents find him, and he runs to hug Jefferson.\\n\\nThe news breaks out that Spider-Man is dead, and that he was Peter Parker. New Yorkers everywhere are devastated. Miles buys a costume (the store owner is the voice of Stan Lee, no less) before attending a memorial service for Peter, with many other fans attending dressed as the wall-crawler. Mary Jane (voice of Zoë Kravitz) delivers a eulogy for her husband while Aunt May (voice of Lily Tomlin) stands solemnly in the back.\\n\\nMiles is inspired by MJ\\'s words to take up the mantle of Spider-Man. He wants to test out his powers, but he isn\\'t quite sure of how to get them to work. He later pays a visit to Peter\\'s grave, just as he is spotted by another man...Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson). In his own words, this Peter tells us that in his universe, he\\'s been Spider-Man for years and is now an adult, but he\\'s lost Aunt May and he was married to Mary Jane but is now divorced due to him not being able to work out his issues as Spidey, as well as him not wanting kids when she did. He became depressed and gained weight, and then the Collider turned on, which pulled him into this dimension. Now after finding Miles, he gets knocked unconscious, leading Miles to try and swing away with him as the police go after them, only to end up crashing on the streets as people walk past them.\\n\\nMiles brings Peter somewhere for safety. He questions Peter as to how it\\'s possible that he\\'s there alive when he correctly guesses the alternate dimension theory. Miles takes out the drive that the Peter of his universe gave him (which other Peter calls a \"goober\"), but it\\'s broken. Peter frees himself and takes the broken goober to try and find a new one so that he can get back home, as being in this dimension causes him to glitch and be unstable. However, before Peter can head off on his own, Miles guilts him into letting him join so that they can make things right together.\\n\\nMiles and Peter, dressed in their costumes, go to Alchemax Labs where the data on the Collider is being kept. As they try to find a way to sneak in, Kingpin and his henchman Tombstone (Marvin Jones III) and his top scientist (voice of Kathryn Hahn). Kingpin\\'s motive for operating the Collider is to be reunited with his wife Vanessa (voice of Lake Bell) and son Richard. Years earlier, they watched as he tried to kill Spider-Man, and they fled from him, only to be tragically hit by a truck.\\n\\nMiles and Peter manage to sneak into the lab and find the room with the computer. Miles starts freaking out again as he can\\'t unstick himself from the ceiling, just as Kingpin and his scientist are outside. Miles then also finds out he can turn invisible while he\\'s scared. The scientist then enters the room, forcing Peter to try and charm her. She is impressed to find Spider-Man alive, but only so she can kill him herself. She then reveals her name to be Dr. Olivia Octavius, aka DOC OCK. She reveals her mechanical tentacles as she attacks Peter, but Miles grabs the computer so that they can go. They are chased by scientists out of the lab and into the woods. The guys swing through the trees as the villains catch up, but Doc Ock gets webbed up by a third spider-person...GWEN. She tells Miles and Peter how she too has come from another dimension where she was bitten by a spider. There, she saved her father\\'s life but couldn\\'t save Peter. The three of them then head out of the woods to get away. Doc Ock later goes back to Kingpin, who is highly displeased to find there are two more Spider-Men around.\\n\\nMiles, Peter, and Gwen to go Aunt May\\'s home, where she is able to figure out that the Peter she sees before her is from another dimension. She takes them to her Peter\\'s old secret hideout, which is full of different suits, gadgets, and vehicles. There, the three meet Spider-Man Noir (voice of Nicolas Cage), a black-and-white old-gangster-talking hero; Peni Parker (voice of Kimiko Glenn) and her robot SP//dr, which is powered by a radioactive spider; and Peter Porker, aka Spider-Ham (voice of John Mulaney), who was actually a spider bitten by a radioactive pig. All of them were pulled from their own dimensions and into Miles\\'s world. They each plan to stay behind and shut down the Collider with a new goober so that the rest can get home, but Miles says it has to be him since this is his dimension. When Peter tries to back him up by stating the cool powers that Miles has, he is unable to turn them on and prove to the others that he is capable of helping. Miles turns invisible and he dejectedly leaves the cave.\\n\\nMiles goes to Aaron\\'s home for help, just as Jefferson and Rio are contacting Aaron since they haven\\'t heard from Miles in a while. Miles finds Aaron\\'s apartment empty, but then encounters Prowler inside, prompting him to go invisible again. Prowler speaks to Kingpin and removes his mask, revealing himself to be Aaron. Miles is horrified. He tries to get out of the apartment but is chased by Aaron throughout the city until he manages to evade him.\\n\\nBack at Aunt May\\'s house, Miles reunites with the other Spider-People to tell them that his uncle is working for Kingpin. Unfortunately, Miles has led Prowler there, along with Doc Ock, Goblin, Tombstone, and Scorpion (voice of Joaquín Cosio). The villains attack, and the Spider-People spring into action. Even Aunt May gets in on it by defending her home. Prowler goes after Miles and chases him to the rooftop. Kingpin orders Prowler to finish Miles off, until Miles takes off his mask to reveal himself to his uncle. Aaron is mortified that he almost killed his nephew. As he backs down, Kingpin shoots Aaron in the back and then goes for Miles, but he swings out of there with his uncle. He takes Aaron to an alley where he is dying. Miles blames himself for what happened, but Aaron encourages him to keep pushing forward. Jefferson finds Miles over Aaron\\'s body, sending Miles fleeing. Jeff then sees his brother and breaks down.\\n\\nMiles returns to his dorm where the other Spider-People meet up with him. They cause his roommate to pass out from seeing them crawl up the wall. Peter webs Miles up to his chair and takes the goober to go stop the Collider, telling Miles it\\'s for his safety. After they leave, Jeff comes up to Miles\\'s dorm outside, but he can\\'t respond thanks to the web. Jeff tells him about Aaron and only wishes for Miles to be okay. Miles then musters up the strength to bring out his power to free himself.\\n\\nMiles goes back to Aunt May\\'s and gets the original Spider-Man suit, which he spray paints with dark colors. He then tests his powers more confidently as he swings around the city.\\n\\nThe other Spider-People find Kingpin\\'s gala where they are able to sneak in because the staff are wearing Spidey masks. Peter sees MJ and tried to express his guilt toward leaving her, even though she doesn\\'t know it\\'s him or what he\\'s talking about. They proceed down to where the Collider is, but Kingpin\\'s henchmen find them and proceed to attack. Miles swings in and joins his comrades as they fight back. To make things worse, the Collider is activated, causing another earthquake across the city as dimensions start warping together.\\n\\nSpider-Man Noir takes on Tombstone while Peni and SP//dr fight Goblin, and Spider-Ham beats up Scorpion with a cartoon mallet. Doc Ock goes after Gwen and Peter while Miles tries to shut the Collider down. The henchmen are taken out, and Doc Ock is plowed by an inter-dimensional truck. Unfortunately, SP//dr is heavily damaged, leaving Peni devastated as Noir and Spider-Ham comfort her. She takes the spider back as they prepare to jump back home. They say their farewells, and Peni goes first, followed by Noir and Spider-Ham. Gwen affirms her friendship with Miles before going home. Peter tried to stay back and help Peter, but Miles chooses to send Peter back so that he can fix what he has to do in his world. Miles then goes after the Collider, but Kingpin starts hitting back hard. He then starts to see a new Vanessa and Richard as their dimensions start crossing over. Just as Kingpin seems to overpower Miles, he sees Jefferson as he enters the area. Miles gets himself up and uses his power to blast Kingpin away and then send him webbed up toward the button to shut down the Collider for good.\\n\\nOutside, Miles calls Jeff to let him know he\\'s okay. He then approaches him as Spider-Man and hugs him, letting him know he\\'s doing a good job, but not letting his dad know who he really is. Jeff then finds Kingpin webbed up and prepped for arrest.\\n\\nMiles now assumes his regular school duties while also taking on his role as the new Spider-Man, earning a number of new fans across the city. Meanwhile, in Peter\\'s dimension, he heads off to patch things up with MJ. As Miles settles in his room for a nap, a dimensional portal opens and he hears Gwen\\'s voice calling to him.\\n\\nThere is a dedication for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.\\n\\nAfter the closing credits, there is a scene where Miguel O\\'Hara/Spider-Man 2099 (voice of Oscar Isaac) learns about the other Spider-People from his assistant Lyla (voice of Greta Lee). He travels to Earth 67 where he ends up in a weird pointing argument with the Spider-Man from the 1960s cartoon.', 'No Synopsis', \"Some time after the events of the first film, Buster Moon is thriving with his new theater. However, he fails to impress talent scout Suki, who tells him he would not make it in Redshore City. Buster, encouraged by Nana Noodleman, reunites the singers who competed in the first film and takes them to the city.\\n\\nThey sneak in for an audition with entertainment mogul Jimmy Crystal. Crystal is uninterested in Buster's original show pitch, therefore, Gunter pitches a space-themed show which would feature Clay Calloway, a rock star who has not been seen in 15 years. Intrigued, Crystal green lights it, telling them to have the show up and running within three weeks.\\n\\nDuring production on the show, Rosita develops a fear of heights during rehearsal and is unable to keep on her role, which is given to Crystal's daughter Porsha while Rosita is delegated to a minor role. Meanwhile, Johnny has been assigned to work with top choreographer Klaus Kickenklober for his part in the show but senses that Klaus dislikes him due to his inability to dance. Johnny comes across a street dancer named Nooshy, who agrees to help him out. Meena has been cast in a romantic scene with Darius, a self-absorbed actor with whom Meena has no chemistry with. She later meets and falls in love with an ice cream vendor named Alfonso.\\n\\nAsh and Buster visit Clay Calloway to convince him to be in the show. He refuses at first, but Ash changes his mind. Back at the theater, Buster asks Porsha if she would like to switch roles with Rosita as she cannot act. Porsha interprets this as Buster firing her. Upon learning this, Crystal blames Porsha for embarrassing him and nearly throws Buster off his building before locking him in a closet. Suki frees Buster and warns him to get out of Redshore City, before Crystal can kill him. Ash arrives with the crew and Calloway, who advises Buster not to run and hide like he did after he lost his wife. Buster then decides to have the cast and crew put on the show one night behind Crystal's back and has Miss Crawly get Porsha to rejoin them in the show.\\n\\nDuring the show, a jealous Klaus takes the place of Johnny's performance partner to try to undermine his number, but Johnny defeats Klaus with encouragement from Nooshy and finally earns Klaus' respect. Meena visualizes Darius as Alfonso and performs a romantic duet with him. Having found out about the show and angered when Porsha stands up to him during her part, Crystal tries to stop it by dropping Buster off the top of the stage which causes Rosita to overcome her fear of heights to save the latter. When the time comes for Calloway to take the stage, he claims that he is not ready. Ash leads the crowd in a rendition of one of Calloway's songs, giving him the courage to perform.\\n\\nAfter the show, Suki has Crystal arrested by the police for endangering Buster and his friends. While Buster and his friends prepare to leave, Suki stops them and tells them that a major theater wants to put on their show. As the cast puts on their first performance, Buster watches from the VIP section, proud to have succeeded in Redshore City.\", 'While escaping her home from armed conflict, a young Alma Madrigal loses her husband Pedro but saves her triplet infant children Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno. The candle Alma carries with her becomes magical and creates a sentient house, the \"Casita\", for the Madrigals to live in. Years later a village grows, protected by the Casita, and members of the Madrigal family are gifted superhuman abilities they use to help the villagers (\"The Family Madrigal\"). However, Bruno\\'s gift of precognition causes multiple conflicts that lead to the family vilifying him, while Mirabel, Julieta\\'s youngest daughter, is treated differently for having no gift at all.\\n\\nDuring the evening of Pepa\\'s youngest son Antonio being gifted with the ability to speak to animals, Mirabel suddenly sees the Casita cracking, but her warnings go unheeded when the Casita is found seemingly fine (\"Waiting On A Miracle\"). Mirabel, resolving to save the magic of the Casita, goes around to investigate and question her family members. Her older sister Luisa - who possesses superhuman strength - suggests that Bruno\\'s room may hold some clues to the phenomenon (\"Surface Pressure\"). There, Mirabel sees a cave of sand and pieces of a slab of opaque jade glass, which - when repaired - constitute an image supposedly showing her causing the Casita to fall apart. After Mirabel leaves, she discovers that her family members\\' gifts are starting to weaken (\"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\").\\n\\nAt a dinner where Mirabel\\'s oldest sister Isabela -who can make flowers grow at will - is to become engaged to neighboring villager Mariano Guzman, Mirabel\\'s oldest cousin Dolores - who possesses superhuman hearing - admits to overhearing Mirabel talking with her father about Bruno\\'s vision. Mariano\\'s proposal gets ruined when the Casita once again begins to crack, causing Pepa - whose emotions control the weather - to conjure up a thunderstorm much to everyone\\'s shock. Isabela then blames Mirabel despite the latter denying her involvement in the cataclysm. Amidst the situation, Mirabel suddenly catches a glimpse of a man who she then chases through a hidden passage in the walls, discovering that he was none other than Bruno himself, who never really left their house because he still loves his family. Mirabel convinces him to make predictions again and gets Antonio\\'s permission to use the latter\\'s room. Bruno makes another vision, which shows the Casita collapsing and an image of Mirabel embracing Isabela.\\n\\nMirabel goes to apologize but instead learns of Isabela\\'s burden of being perfect and her desire not to marry Mariano. Having poured out her feelings, Isabela\\'s powers start to develop and both sisters reconcile (\"What Else Can I Do?\"). However, Alma discovers Mirabel\\'s actions and thoughtlessly blames her for the family\\'s misfortunes. Mirabel then finally snaps at her, saying how everything was truly all her fault for making everyone do things her way. Their argument suddenly creates a gigantic fissure that destroys the Casita while Alma\\'s magical candle extinguishes in Mirabel\\'s hands in her futile effort to save it, effectively stripping the Madrigals of their powers.\\n\\nAlma later finds a tearful Mirabel at the river where Pedro died and finally admits her fault of pressuring the family, forgetting that the real gift given was not the powers but the family itself (\"Dos Oruguitas\"). Both reconcile and, with Bruno in tow, reunite the Madrigals to rebuild the Casita, assisted by the villagers. When Mirabel places the last doorknob, the Casita springs back to life and the magic returns (\"All Of You\"). The movie ends with the Madrigals taking their first family picture with Mirabel and Bruno now included in it (\"Colombia, Mi Encanto\").', 'Sometime before Puss (Antonio Banderas) meets Shrek and Donkey in Shrek 2, he arrives at a town while escaping a bounty hunter. There he learns that the outlaw couple Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris) have the magic beans he\\'s been looking for most of his life, beans that can lead him to a giant\\'s castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws\\' room, a masked cat (Salma Hayek) interrupts. Both fail and escape, and Puss follows the cat back to Cat Cantina, a club, where they have a dance-off and a sword fight, ending when Puss hits the masked cat in the head with a guitar. He learns that the masked cat is Kitty Softpaws, and is shocked to learn she is a girl. She is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), a talking egg and Puss\\' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a crime. It turned out that Kitty was sleeping through the story. Humpty attempts to convince Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs, which he does.\\n\\nThe trio steals the beans from Jack and Jill and elude the angry outlaws in a canyon chase. As Humpty leads his compatriots to the spot where they must plant the beans, Puss and Kitty\\'s relationship begins to grow from rivalry into friendship. The trio ride the fast-growing beanstalk into the clouds where, Humpty explains, they\\'ll find castle of the late giant. Now, he continues, a fearsome monster called the Terror guards the Golden Goose. When they realize the golden eggs are too heavy to carry, they steal the Goose which is just a gosling and escape the castle and the Terror. While celebrating their victory, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, who knock Puss unconscious.\\n\\nWhen Puss wakes up, he tracks Jack and Jill back to his old hometown, where he learns that the entire heist was a plot by Humpty to lure him home to be captured, as revenge for abandoning him to the authorities when Humpty\\'s youthful heist went bad. Jack, Jill, and even Kitty were involved in the con. After pleas from his adoptive mother, the head of the orphanage, Puss turns himself in to the guards while Humpty donates many golden eggs to the town and becomes a hero.\\n\\nWhile in prison, Puss meets the original Jack from the \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" (a.k.a. Andy Beanstalk) story who warns him that the Terror is in fact the Golden Goose\\'s mother, and it will stop at nothing to get its child back. A repentant Kitty helps Puss break out of prison and tells him that she loves him more than gold. Puss convinces Humpty to help him fight off the Terror, saying he knows Humpty is a good person at heart, and he will be forgiven if he helps save the town. The Terror arrives, revealing itself to be a giant goose. Using the Golden Goose as bait, Puss and Humpty lure the Terror out of the town, but Humpty and the Goose are knocked off a bridge with Puss holding on to them. Humpty knows Puss cannot hold both of them, and he lets go, sacrificing himself to save the Goose and the town. Humpty\\'s shell cracks open to reveal that he was a golden egg on the inside. The Terror then takes the Goose and Humpty away back to the giant\\'s castle.\\n\\nPuss is forced to flee because he is still an outlaw, but his efforts to save the town make him a hero among the townspeople. Puss and Kitty escape the guards once more, and Kitty says she will see him again soon, showing that she has taken his boots. In the epilogue, Jack and Jill are recovering from their injuries after being crushed by the Terror, Humpty is shown once again in his regular egg form, wearing a golden egg suit, as he rides the Terror into the clouds, and Puss and Kitty head back to dance at Kitty\\'s hideout, the Glitter Box, where they finally kiss.', 'No Synopsis', 'No Synopsis', 'The Lion King takes place in the Pride Lands of Africa, where a lion rules over the other animals as king. As dawn breaks, all the animals of the Pride Lands are summoned to Pride Rock, the home of the pride of lions. Rafiki (Robert Guillaume), a mandrill, walks through the herd and climbs the face of Pride Rock to greet his friend, King Mufasa (James Earl Jones). Mufasa leads Rafiki to his mate Sarabi (Madge Sinclair) who is holding their newborn cub. Rafiki anoints the cub with fruit juices before presenting him to the gathered animals. The animals cheer and then bow to the new future king.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Scar (Jeremy Irons), the younger brother of Mufasa, is sulking by himself behind Pride Rock. He is envious of his brother\\'s position as king and is disgruntled at the fact that he will never be king now that Mufasa has an heir. Mufasa and his majordomo, a hornbill named Zazu (Rowan Atkinson), confront Scar on why he wasn\\'t present at the ceremony that morning. Scar shrugs it off, claiming he had forgotten, and scoffs his new responsibility to show respect to the future king before wandering off.\\n\\nAs monsoon storms drench the Pride Lands, Rafiki is seen in his tree home, a large baobab, adding details to his newest piece of wall art. He chuckles lightly as he finishes, reciting the new cub\\'s name, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas).\\n\\nNow a budding youth, Simba rises early one morning and pesters his father to get up and show him the lands he\\'s destined to rule over. Mufasa illustrates from the top of Pride Rock that everything the light touches is their kingdom, except for a place on the horizon that is covered in shadow. Mufasa tells Simba he\\'s forbidden from ever going there. Out in the plains, Mufasa tells Simba that there is a balance to all life which eventually comes full circle; the Circle of Life. When Zazu appears with a morning report, Mufasa takes the opportunity to give Simba a pouncing lesson which goes successfully, much to Zazu\\'s dismay. As Simba gets ready to try again, Zazu suddenly exclaims that a group of hyenas has been seen in the Pride Lands. Mufasa rushes off to deal with it while Zazu takes Simba home.\\n\\nSimba returns to Pride Rock where his Uncle Scar is lurking about. Simba brags about his fate to be king to which Scar reacts without the slightest bit of enthusiasm. Casually, and goading Simba\\'s excitement, Scar asks if Mufasa showed him the shadow place on their morning walk. When Simba replies no, Scar adds that it is a dangerous place where only the bravest lions venture. Simba perks up, saying he\\'s brave, and begs his uncle to tell him what\\'s there. Scar feigns an accidental slip of the tongue by revealing that it\\'s an elephant graveyard but praises Simba\\'s cleverness. He asks that Simba never explore the place, but as Simba reassures him and leaves, Scar smiles to himself knowing full well that Simba\\'s curiosity will get the better of him.\\n\\nSimba meets up with his friend Nala (Niketa Calame-Harris) who is being bathed by her mother, Sarafina Zoe Leader. He tells her about a cool place he has found, lying to Sarabi that its around the water hole. Sarabi gives them permission to go as long as Zazu accompanies them. Along the way, Simba and Nala devise a plan together to get rid of Zazu, which works. They then run off, Nala showing off her skills as an expert pinner, before finding themselves in the elephant graveyard. Suddenly, Zazu reappears and demands that they leave. Simba shows off his bravery by laughing in front of a large skull. Laughter echoes from within and three hyenas emerge, surrounding the cubs. Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), Banzai (Cheech Marin), and Ed (Jim Cummings) deliberate what\\'s to be done with the cubs, more specifically, how to eat them. The cubs and Zazu escape for a moment, but Zazu is pulled back and stuffed into a boiler which shoots him into the air. The hyenas eventually corner the cubs in an alcove and Simba tries to roar. The hyenas laugh and tell him to try again. A real roar is let out as Mufasa appears and attacks the hyenas before they run off. Zazu reappears by Mufasa\\'s side and Simba tries to say something but Mufasa furiously reprimands him for being deliberately disobedient and leads them towards home.\\n\\nBack in the Pride Lands, Mufasa tells Zazu to take Nala home while he teaches Simba a lesson. Fearful and meek, Simba walks up to his father, noticing that his father\\'s paw print is much bigger than his own. He apologizes for disobeying but says he only wanted to be brave like Mufasa. Mufasa tells Simba he\\'s only brave when he has to be. As they reconcile, Mufasa tells Simba that all the stars in the night sky are the spirits of kings past and that they will always be there to guide him, as will he.\\n\\nBack in the graveyard, the hyenas lick their wounds and quarrel with each other. Their fights are broken up by Scar who is greeted as a friend. Irritated that the hyenas couldn\\'t dispose of the cubs, he proposes a plan that would eliminate both Simba and Mufasa from the throne.\\n\\nThe next day, Scar escorts Simba through a gorge and puts him near a rock shaded by a sapling, telling him that Mufasa is planning a surprise for him. Scar instructs Simba to stay put while he fetches Mufasa and suggests that he practice his roar while he\\'s away. Just above the gorge, the three hyenas lie in wait in front of a massive herd of wildebeest. Scar appears above them, signaling them. As Simba waits, scowling over his little roar, a chameleon climbs down from the tree. Simba practices roaring at it, finally letting off one loud enough to scare the chameleon and echo off all sides of the gorge. But the ground starts shaking and Simba looks up to see the herd of wildebeest charging down the gorge straight for him. He runs away, the wildebeest gaining, while Scar warns Mufasa nearby that there is a stampede in the gorge and Simba is down there. Simba manages to grab hold of a broken tree, elevating himself above the wildebeests\\' horns while Mufasa climbs down and runs alongside the animals. He manages to grab Simba in his mouth and carries him to safety, but is pulled back by the charging animals. After a tense moment, Simba watches his father leap onto the side of the gorge, digging his claws into the dirt and struggling up the hillside. As Mufasa nears the top, he sees Scar standing over him. He pleads for help, but Scar digs his claws into his paws and mocks him before pushing him off. Simba watches helplessly as Mufasa falls onto the stampeding herd.\\n\\nAs the dust settles, Simba runs down to look for his father. He discovers him beneath a broken tree, dead. As he mourns his loss, Scar appears and blames Simba for what happened. Simba, thinking he had started the stampede that killed his father, follows his uncles advice when Scar tells him to run away and never return. Simba runs off as Scar instructs his hyenas to kill him. The three hyenas chase Simba to the edge of an incline where he tumbles into a sea of brambles. Small enough to avoid the sharp spikes, Simba runs through them as the hyenas barely manage to stop near the base. Unlucky Banzai is shoved into the brambles and emerges howling, stuck with thorns. The hyenas watch as Simba runs into the distant desert and decide that he will most likely die, shouting to him that if he ever comes back they will kill him.\\n\\nScar returns to Pride Rock to announce that both Simba and Mufasa have perished in the stampede and assumes the role as king. The lionesses look on in fear as a horde of hyenas arrives to live alongside Scar at Pride Rock. Rafiki watches sullenly from a distance and smears the image he had once created of Simba.\\n\\nIn the desert, Simba has collapsed under the heat and a group of vultures descends on him. Suddenly, a meerkat and a warthog charge into them, bucking and kicking them away as part of their favorite game; bowling for buzzards. The warthog, Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), then discovers Simba and brings him to the attention of his meerkat companion, Timon (Nathan Lane). Timon is initially afraid of the young lion but Pumbaa asserts that he\\'s still little and will grow up to be on their side instead of eating them. Timon scoffs at the idea, before suggesting the very same thing as his own. Pumbaa picks Simba up and carries him into the shade where he\\'s revived. Simba thanks them for their help before walking away. Timon and Pumbaa take pity on him and tell him that, whatever happened to him, he has to put his past behind him, citing their motto Hakuna Matata; no worries. They then invite Simba to stay with them as a fellow outcast in their jungle paradise and teach him to eat bugs rather than meat. Simba begins to cheer up and eventually grows into a healthy, carefree adult (Matthew Broderick).\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Pride Lands have been reduced to a wasteland under Scars rule. Zazu is confined to a bone cage singing while Scar lazily lies about chewing on bones. Zazu mutters under his breath that he never had to do this under Mufasa. Scar reels on the name, citing that the law is to never mention Mufasas name. Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed appear, complaining that food and water have become scarce and that the lionesses refuse to hunt. Scar suggests they eat Zazu as Banzai lets slip Mufasas name before he corrects himself under Scars glare. Scar then dismisses them.\\n\\nBack in the jungle, Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa lie down together after a meal of bugs to look up at the night sky. Pumbaa asks what the sparkling lights in the sky are to which Timon replies that they\\'re fireflies that got stuck in the big, bluish-black thing. Pumbaa says he\\'d always thought they were burning balls of gas billions of miles away, a theory which Timon debunks due to Pumbaa\\'s flatulent nature. They ask Simba what he thinks. Answering only to their begging, he says he was once told that the lights are great kings of the past watching over them. Timon starts cracking up over the thought of royal dead guys watching them, but Simba wanders off, saddened over the memory of his father. He sighs and collapses onto a bunch of wild flowers, spreading their petals and leaves to the wind. The wind carries them back to the Pride Lands where Rafiki, sitting atop his tree, grabs them. He takes them back into the tree where he sniffs them and contemplates the apparent familiar smell. Suddenly it strikes him; Simba must be alive. Crazed with happiness, he quickly smears a mane around the head of his Simba drawing, stating that it is time.\\n\\nTimon and Pumbaa are walking through the jungle together when Pumbaa becomes distracted by a large rhino beetle. Hungry, he follows it to the edge of the jungle and sneaks up on it as its perched on a log facing some grassland. His eye then catches something in the tall grass as the beetle flies away. Pumbaa screams as a lioness emerges from the grasses and gives chase. Hearing Pumbaa, Timon comes running and finds him stuck in the roots of a tree. He tries to free Pumbaa as the lioness draws closer. She leaps forward but Simba jumps in and begins to fight with her while Timon cheers him on. He tries to knock her down but she flips him over and pins him to the ground. Simba recognizes this move and his old friend, Nala (Moira Kelly). When he reveals himself, Nala is shocked and happy to see him again. Simba introduces her to Pumbaa and Timon, who is less than happy about the reunion since Nala had tried to eat Pumbaa. Nala tells Simba that everyone in the Pride Lands thought he was dead after Scar told them about the stampede. Nervous, Simba asks what else Scar told them, but Nala says that it doesn\\'t matter now that he\\'s alive and the rightful king. Simba excuses Timon and Pumbaa to speak to Nala alone. As they walk through the jungle together the romantic settings encourage their feelings for each other, though Simba is hesitant to talk to Nala about his past. She tries to get Simba to go back to the Pride Lands with her, telling him that everything has fallen into disarray since Scar took the throne. He refuses, explaining that he shouldn\\'t worry about things that happened in the past, which angers Nala. She tells Simba that returning to the throne is his responsibility but he storms off and walks out of the jungle to an open field. He tries to justify his decision before yelling at the night sky that Mufasa wasn\\'t there for him and feeling solemn that it was his fault.\\n\\nHe then hears singing coming from a tree behind him and sees Rafiki in the branches. Irritated, he walks away. Rafiki follows him and asks him a series of rhetorical questions and chanting seemingly nonsensical words. Convinced that the baboon is crazy and confused, Simba turns to walk away when Rafiki reveals that he knows Simba is Mufasas son. Rafiki then runs off and Simba follows. He finds Rafiki mediating on a rock and asks if he knew his father. Rafiki says \"I know your father\", to which Simba responds that he died. Rafiki laughs, saying that Mufasa is alive, and leads Simba through a thicket of trees and vines. They stop at a reflecting pool and Rafiki instructs Simba to look into it. Seeing only his reflection at first, Simba looks harder and sees an image of Mufasa. Rafiki says that Mufasa lives within him as a large storm cloud appears overhead and a specter of Mufasa speaks out to Simba, saying that he has forgotten who he is and that he must take his rightful place as the true king of Pride Rock. Simba begs his father to stay but the apparition disappears, echoing that Simba must remember who he is. As Simba contemplates the message and the change in the winds, Rafiki wallops him over the head with his staff. Outraged and in pain, Simba asks what he did that for. Rafiki says that it doesn\\'t matter because its in the past, but though the past may still hurt, one can either run from it or learn from it. He swings his staff again and Simba ducks before grabbing the staff and throwing it away. Then Rafiki watches and cheers as Simba runs off, announcing that he\\'s going back.\\n\\nTimon and Pumbaa are sleeping together as Nala approaches them and nudges them awake, frightening them at first. She asks if they\\'ve seen Simba but Rafiki appears overhead and declares that the king has returned. Confused by this statement and Rafikis mysterious arrival and departure, Timon and Pumbaa listen as Nala tries to explain that Simba has decided to go back to the Pride Lands to take his place as king.\\n\\nCrossing the desert, Simba finally arrives in the Pride Lands to find it dark and barren. He eyes Pride Rock with a look of vengeance when Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa appear beside him. They all agree to help Simba reclaim the throne, though Timon is less than impressed by the landscape they\\'re fighting for. They sneak over to Pride Rock and discover that its crawling with hyenas. Simba offers Timon and Pumbaa as live bait and they do put on a colorful performance for the hungry hyenas while he and Nala move closer. Simba instructs Nala to rally the lionesses while he looks for Scar. He finds him at the base of Pride Rock, calling loudly for Sarabi. Hyenas nip at her heels as she approaches and Simba looks on mournfully. Scar questions her as to why the lionesses refuse to hunt. Sarabi explains that the herds have moved on and their only chance for survival is to leave Pride Rock. Scar refuses and, when Sarabi compares him to Mufasa, he cruelly hits her. Having seen enough, Simba appears on a ledge and runs down to comfort his mother. Scar backs away, fearful that its Mufasa that has returned, but when he realizes who it really is, he shoots a hateful glare at Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Simba confronts Scar, demanding that he step down from the throne or fight, but sly Scar asks why things must end in violence and says he would feel terrible if he were responsible for the death of a family member. Though Simba says he\\'s put the past behind him, Scar questions whether the lionesses have done the same. When Nala questions this, Scar prompts Simba to tell them all who was responsible for Mufasas death. Sadly, Simba confesses that he was, though it was an accident. Scar uses this and accuses Simba of being a murderer, backing him up to the end of Pride Rock to the point where Simba slips over the edge, dangling by his paws. Lightning strikes and ignites a fire beneath him as Scar looks over him, remarking that this was just the way Mufasa looked before he died. Then Scar grabs Simbas paws and whispers in his ear that he was the one to kill Mufasa.\\n\\nEnraged, Simba leaps over the edge and pins Scar, choking him to confess the truth to the lionesses. Fighting immediately breaks out between the hyenas and the lions. Timon and Pumbaa join the fray with their signature bowling moves and Rafiki impresses with some acrobatic martial arts. When Timon is cornered by Shenzi and Banzai in the lions den with Zazu, Pumbaa comes to the rescue, his fury provoked when Banzai accidentally calls him a pig.\\n\\nScar manages to slip away from the fighting but is followed by Simba. They meet at the top of Pride Rock surrounded by flames where Scar begs for his life, saying that he\\'s family and that the hyenas are the real enemy. Having heard this, the hyenas back away growling. Simba relents, saying that he\\'s not like Scar and tells him to run away and never return. Scar meekly walks past him but sends a pile of embers into Simbas face, blinding him for a moment. Scar then attacks Simba and a fierce fight ensues. Scar manages to knock Simba down and leaps at him but, using the technique Nala had mastered in her pinning, Simba flips Scar with his hind legs over the edge of Pride Rock. Scar tumbles down the rock face and lands at the base. He groggily stands up and notices the hyenas approaching him from between the flames. He greets them as his friends but they respond that he said they were the enemy. Scar looks at them in horror as they lick their lips and surround him before attacking.\\n\\nRain begins to fall and Simba returns to the lionesses where he greets his mother and Nala. Rafiki rattles his staff and points it towards the tip of Pride Rock. He bows to Simba, who gives him a hug, and says it is time. As everyone watches, and as the rain washes away dust and bones, Simba ascends Pride Rock, gazing one last time at the heavens before letting out a mighty roar and sealing his position as king. The lionesses join in, hailing their new king. Some time later, the animals of the Pride Lands gather once again at Pride Rock, cheering at Simba and Nala as they overlook the kingdom. Rafiki comes between them and holds up their newborn cub for all to see.', 'The year 1976 is where the story begins. Belle Bottom, played by Taraji P. Henson, is a supervillain who is being pursued by the Anti-Villain League as she races across the city after stealing a map. Following her victory over the AVL agents, Belle makes her way to her hiding place at the Criminal Records record store. There, she meets the other members of her team, the Vicious 6, including their founder, Wild Knuckles, as well as members Strong Hold (Danny Trejo), Nun-Chuck (Lucy Lawless), Svengeance (Dolph Lundgren), and Jean-Clawed (Jean-Claude Van Damme) (Alan Arkin). They examine the map, and upon doing so, they discover that it details the location of an artifact known as the Zodiac Stone. Utilizing this artifact during the Chinese New Year transforms its users into powerful animals. The Vicious 6 traveled by plane to a remote island in search of the Stone. Wild Knuckles makes his way inside the temple and discovers the Zodiac Stone, but as soon as he does so, he is ambushed by a number of small metal guardians. He engages them in combat and then escapes the temple, only to discover that additional temple guards are pursuing him. The remaining five of the six pull Knuckles up, but then they steal the Stone from him and turn the tables on him, telling him that he is too old to lead the team and that they need new blood to take over instead. They cast Knuckles into the water and then take off into the sky. Young Gru, played by Steve Carell, is 11 years old and has always had the ambition of becoming a supervillain. As a result, the other children view him as a peculiar individual and avoid his company. Kevin, Bob, and Stuart are the ones who come to get him (all Pierre Coffin, along with the rest of the Minions). They make their way back to Gru\\'s residence, where he discovers something that was sent to him in the mail. It is a message from Belle Bottom, as Gru had sent an application to join the Vicious 6 since he is their biggest fan, and Knuckles is his favorite villain. The context of the message is that Knuckles is Gru\\'s favorite villain (or, was). Gru receives an invitation from Belle to attend an audition that will take place at the Criminal Records shop. Gru is ecstatic and believes that his time to shine as a supervillain has finally arrived. He is seen just living with his unsupportive mother Marlena, who is played by Julie Andrews, as well as the rest of the Minions that he has employed as his henchmen. He is seen just living with them. Gru relays the exciting news to the Minions, who enthusiastically rally behind their \"mini boss\" despite Gru\\'s displeasure with the moniker. It has been discovered that Wild Knuckles is in fact still alive and is currently residing in his mansion along with three of his own goons (John DiMaggio, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Jimmy O. Yang). He hasn\\'t gotten over the fact that the Vicious 6 kicked him off his own team, and now he\\'s heard that they\\'re looking for a new member to join them. This has made him very bitter. The following day, Gru makes it to Criminal Records, where he is introduced to a younger version of Dr. Nefario, played by Russell Brand and described as an ambitious mad scientist. He demonstrates one of his most recent creations to Gru, which is a rifle that fires a sticky green hand that can grab anything. Nefario hands it over to Gru and then walks him through the hidden passageway that leads to the Vicious 6\\'s lair. However, when he finally meets them, they dismiss him for being a youngster because Jean-Clawed imagined that he was a tiny man when they were reviewing his application. As they walk away, another candidate walks in and tries to impress everyone with his pilot outfit, but his jetpack suddenly stops working, causing him to soar erratically through the air. The Vicious 6 make an effort to stop him, which diverts their attention just as Gru discovers the Zodiac Stone hiding behind them. He steals the Stone by using the revolver that Nefario gave him, but the six of them find him and begin to pursue him. Gru catches up with the other minions and hands the Stone over to one of them, named Otto. Gru flees on his horse while the six warriors pursue him. He makes it so that Strong Hold and Nun-Chuck are unable to defend themselves, and when Belle and Svengeance grab a hold of Gru\\'s bike, he uses the rocket to get them out from there as quickly as possible. Knuckles, who was there the whole time, now follows Gru around in his vehicle after seeing all that happened. Once Gru and the other Minions have returned to their home, they wait for Otto to return from work. When he does, he gives Gru a rock that has googly eyes attached to it as a gift. Otto adds that he ended up going through a series of unfortunate events until he found up at a birthday party, at which point he traded the Stone for the pet rock that was being given away to the birthday boy. Because of Otto\\'s mistake, Gru is fuming with rage, and he immediately fires all of the Minion workers. He sets off on his own to locate the Stone, but as he walks along the street, the goons working for Knuckles capture him and put him into their van, as Kevin watches from outside the window of the vehicle. He then proceeds to inform the other Minion workers that their mini boss has been taken hostage. Gru is taken to where Wild Knuckles has been hiding out. Knuckles is perturbed to discover that Gru is not in possession of the Stone, which causes Gru to be overjoyed at the prospect of meeting his hero. He calls Gru\\'s house in an effort to coerce his mother into paying a ransom, but Kevin answers the phone instead. Knuckles tells him to bring the Stone to San Francisco within the next two days or they will kill Gru. Otto, Kevin, and Stuart go to the kid\\'s house that Otto gave the Stone to, and Bob joins them there as well. The youngster explains that he handed it over to his uncle, who goes by the name RZA and is already riding away on a motorcycle. Otto and the other three Minions chase after him on a tricycle as they search for a bus for an advertisement to take them to San Francisco. They go to the airport, where they put on disguises and pretend to be pilots and a flight attendant in order to join the following flight. Kevin and Stuart make an attempt to fly, but they wind up messing everything up by pressing all of the buttons and making a whole mess of things before safely landing (sort of). Knuckles torments Gru by placing him in a gadget resembling a record player, which brings him closer and closer to saws that are rotating. He dispatches his underlings into the world, and those underlings end up discovering the Minions. They attempt to seize them since they believe the Stone is in their possession, and as a result, they find themselves in Chinatown, where an acupuncturist named Master Chow (Michelle Yeoh) watches the goons beat on the Minions. Chow, despite her age and the fact that she is a little old lady, demonstrates remarkable kung fu skills and fights off the goons. Chow informs the Minions that she is no longer active in that line of work when they beg her to teach them her abilities. Nevertheless, she gives in after the three of them give her the puppy eye expression. After the incident, the henchmen decided to give up on Knuckles. After rescuing Gru from the trap, he puts Gru to work around the house. Knuckles drowns while he is in the process of cleaning his crocodile-filled pool. Knuckles is grateful that Gru was able to rescue him and drag him out of the pit in which he was trapped. He takes Gru along with him on the burglary. They pretend to be a grandfather and grandson so that they can rob the Bank of Evil. Knuckles acts as though he is having a heart attack so that Gru can steal the keys from Mr. Perkins\\' house (Will Arnett). Gru is successful in his attempt to steal the Mona Lisa, much to Knuckles\\' delight. Otto pursues the Biker on his tricycle through a number of states, but he is unable to keep up with him and eventually loses sight of him. Otto is eventually found by the Biker, who then takes him up, transports him to San Francisco on his motorcycle, and presents him with the Stone. Chow teaches the Minion gang various forms of martial arts, but more often than not, the Minion gang injures themselves rather than improving their skills. They are able to quickly improve their talents, despite Chow\\'s assertion that they have only passed the basic training. Unfortunately, the Minions have already made their escape, and they are already traveling to help Gru. The Vicious 6 locate Gru\\'s house, rip off its roof, and then question Marlena and the other Minions about the whereabouts of Gru. The fact that Gru was kidnapped by Knuckles is revealed by one of the Minions. The group of six then travels to Knuckles\\' residence, where they proceed to rip the roof off, search the property thoroughly, and come up empty-handed. When Knuckles and Gru return, they find that Gru\\'s home has been demolished. He is angry because he is aware that the 6 were the ones who did this, and he is frustrated that they would still try to injure him after all of this time has passed. In spite of Gru\\'s protests, he breaks the news to him that he is given up and just instructs him to go back home. A parade celebrating the Chinese New Year is currently taking place downtown. Otto ultimately causes a commotion by dashing into the crowd. Gru spies him as he is on the trolley and immediately starts chasing after him. Otto reveals the Stone to Gru, who then professes his admiration for Otto. Regrettably, the Vicious 6 have managed to catch up to them, and now have Gru in their custody. In the nick of time, just as they are about to be surrounded by the Anti-Villain League, Belle seizes the Stone and uses its abilities to transform both her and the crew into enormous animal monsters. Strong Hold transforms into a bull, Nun-Chuck into a snake, Svengeance into a tiger, and Jean-Clawed into a monstrous monkey. Belle transforms into a dragon that breathes fire (with his lobster claw arm). They seize Gru and bind him to the hands of a clock tower, which will gradually rip him to pieces over time. Knuckles, Kevin, Stuart, and Bob all appear to come to Gru\\'s rescue at the same time. The three are reincarnated as a rabbit, a chicken, and a ram after being transformed by Belle. Despite the fact that Knuckles puts up a valiant effort, Belle is able to defeat him with her fire breath. The three individuals recall what Chow had said and let loose their inner animals; they then proceed to defeat the mutated version of Vicious 6. Gru is set free by Otto, and he immediately heads off to assist his buddies. The three Minions easily dispatch the six, and Gru seizes the Stone, which he then employs to transform his opponents into rats. They were taken into arrest by the AVL when they arrived. Knuckles suffers an injury and is subsequently detained; nonetheless, he assures Gru that they will meet again in the near future. The scene then cuts to a funeral, where it would appear that Knuckles has passed away. Gru delivers a heartfelt eulogy for him, only to later discover that Knuckles staged his own death and is in hiding. Following the performance of the Minion version of \"You Can\\'t Always Get What You Want,\" Gru is reunited with his idol, and the two of them continue their journey into the sunset with the remaining Minions. During the roll of credits, Gru leads the rehired Minions to the Criminal Records business, which has the appearance of being closed. Gru asks Dr. Nefario whether he would be interested in officially working for him and building gadgets, but Nefario responds by saying that he is retiring from the criminal underworld. After Gru and the Minions have successfully persuaded him with their puppy eyes, he reveals a surprise to Gru, which is the rocket car that Gru is seen driving as an adult. The newly formed evil crew immediately sets its sights on committing even more heinous acts', 'Ten-year-old Chihiro (voice: Daveigh Chase in the 2002 English dub) and her parents (voices: Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis) drive to their new home. Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.\\n\\nAfter wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that\\'s well stocked with food-though it\\'s mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro\\'s objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there\\'s a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they\\'re still eating-and they\\'ve turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents. Chihiro runs back to the river, which was nearly dry when they came over but is now full and large, and she doesn\\'t even recognize the buildings on the far side. As a riverboat approaches, she notices that her body has become transparent.\\n\\nThe riverboat lands a big crowd of people in costume-or maybe they\\'re not people; at first they\\'re only visible as paper masks. Chihiro thinks shes dreaming, but can\\'t wake up. The boy who warned her away finds her and tells her she must eat some food from his world or she\\'ll fade away. He assures her that she won\\'t turn into a pig. She swallows the morsel he gives her and becomes solid, but finds that she\\'s stuck to the ground until he recites an incantation to release her. A bird with a woman\\'s head flies above them and he hides her, saying the bird is looking for her. They run through alleys and the pig barn to the big bathhouse, which is accessed by a bridge; the boy says she has to hold her breath as they cross the bridge or the spell that makes her invisible will be broken. Customers-fantastically varied gods and spirits-are crossing the bridge and being greeted by bathhouse staff. Chihiro makes it almost all the way across, but a frog (voice: Bob Bergen) that speaks to her companion (calling him Haku) startles her and she takes a breath. Luckily only the frog seems to see her, and Haku uses magic to encase it in a bubble to shut it up.\\n\\nHaku tells her to find Kamajii (voice: David Ogden Stiers), the boiler man, and make him give her a job; she must have a job to stay at the bathhouse, or else Yubaba (voice: Suzanne Pleshette), the old witch who rules the bathhouse, will turn her into an animal. And Haku says she has to stay if she wants to find and help her parents, who are still pigs, wherever they are. He knows her name and says he\\'s known her since she was very small.\\n\\nChihiro descends a steep, winding, rail-less wooden stairway in search of Kamajii and the boiler room. When she finds them, she sees a weird set-up in which the boiler is fed by creatures like spiders (delivering coal one lump at a time) and the machinery is controlled by a bearded, bald man with six arms and dark glasses-Kamajii. She asks for a job, but he says-after grumbling about four bath tokens at once, as four red plaques on purple ribbons descend from the ceiling-that he\\'s cast a spell on sootballs (the spider-things) so he has all the workers he needs. Chihiro has to keep moving to stay out the way of Kamajii and the sootballs. She picks up a lump of coal that\\'s too heavy for the sootball carrying it-and almost too heavy for her-and Kamajii tells her to finish what she started, so she hauls it over to the furnace and tosses it in. All the sootballs pretend to collapse under the weight of their coal so they won\\'t have to work, but Kamajii scolds them and Chihiro, saying that if they don\\'t keep working, the spell will wear off. A young woman comes in with food for Kamajii and the sootballs. The woman is shocked to see Chihiro-\"you\\'re the human everyone is looking for!\"-but Kamajii says she\\'s his granddaughter and asks the woman to take Chihiro to Yubaba, who will give her something to do. The woman, whose name is Lin (voice: Susan Egan), only agrees when Kamajii offers her a roasted newt; she brusquely tells Chihiro to leave her shoes and socks behind and to thank the boiler man-\"he\\'s really sticking his neck out for you.\"\\n\\nThey take three elevators to Yubaba\\'s rooms on the top floor, seeing many of the bathhouse\\'s clients-Lin calls one a radish spirit-between elevators. An elevator operator who hasn\\'t spotted Chihiro tells Lin she smells just like a human. Lin distracts him with the roasted newt that Kamajii gave her while Chihiro escapes in the last elevator with the radish spirit. They arrive at a courtyard-like room with a mosaic floor and two big front doors; Chihiro tries to open one. The door knocker says, \"aren\\'t you even going to knock? You\\'re the most pathetic little girl I\\'ve ever seen!\" The doors open and the same voice (Suzanne Pleshette)-it\\'s Yubaba-tells her to come in; she\\'s pulled through the house into a fire-lit room in which several disembodied green heads bounce around, and Yubaba, an old woman with a huge head, works at a desk. Chihiro asks for a job, but Yubaba calls it foolishness, makes disparaging remarks about Chihiro, and silences her with magic. She smokes a cigarette as she considers what to do with Chihiro. She lifts the silencing spell to ask Chihiro who helped her, but Chihiro only continues to ask for work, which makes Yubaba angry. When Chihiro persists, Yubaba offers, \"maybe I\\'ll give you the most difficult job I\\'ve got and work you until you breathe your very last breath.\" They\\'re interrupted when Yubaba\\'s enormous baby, Bôh (voice: Tara Strong) wakes up, which Yubaba blames on Chihiro. Chihiro keeps asking for work and Yubaba finally agrees to give her a job if she\\'ll be quiet. Chihiro signs a contract while Yubaba grouses, \"I can\\'t believe I took that oath to give a job to anyone who asks.\" Yubaba, observing that Chihiro is a pretty name, magically lifts all but one of the characters of Chihiro\\'s name from the contract and says that the name belongs to her now. Reading the one character that remains of Chihiro\\'s name, Yubaba says \"from now on, your name is Sen.\" Haku (pretending not to know her) comes to show her what to do. He says she must address him as Master Haku.\\n\\nNone of the workers want to take Chihiro/Sen into their department, complaining that she smells bad, but Haku says her smell will be gone after three days of eating their food. Haku assigns Chihiro/Sen to work with Lin because Lin had been asking for an assistant. Lin takes Sen to their room, which they share with several others, and gives her clothing (a blue apron and pink shirt and pants). Sen asks if there are two Hakus. Lin says no, and that Sen must be careful what she says to Haku because he\\'s Yubaba\\'s henchman. Sen doesn\\'t feel well.\\n\\nYubaba turns into a bird with a human head and flies off her balcony with a smaller but otherwise identical human-headed bird.\\n\\nAs Sen lies sleeping among her new coworkers, a voice (Haku\\'s) says \"meet me at the bridge; I\\'ll take you to your parents.\" She wakes up, dresses in her new clothes, and goes down to the boiler room where she left her shoes. When she observes \"my shoes are gone,\" the sootballs bring them out of the tunnels where they live.\\n\\nSen makes her way out to the bridge, where a semitransparent spirit is standing. It wears a white mask and a black robe. Silently, it watches her cross; it was standing in the same spot in the middle of the bridge when she crossed the night before. Haku finds her at the other side and leads her through flowering shrubs to the huge piggery. He says she must never come there without him. She identifies a couple of sleeping pigs-there are hundreds-as her parents, and promises to help them. Haku says she must remember which pigs are her parents. He gives her back her old clothes, which she\\'ll need to escape, and a card with her real name, Chihiro, which Sen has almost forgotten already. (She called herself Sen when she spoke to her parents.) Haku says Yubaba exerts power over people by stealing their names; she must not forget hers as he has forgotten his. He gives her something to eat. She cries as she eats and he tries to comfort her. Then Haku has to go; he leaves her at the bridge. When she turns back to look for him, she sees a dragon flying away and realizes that it\\'s Haku. Later, Kamajii finds Sen asleep on the floor of the boiler room; he covers her up.\\n\\nYubaba-bird and her smaller companion fly home through heavy rain. Inside the bathhouse, Lin asks Sen where she was; Sen apologizes but doesn\\'t explain. Sen, Lin, and other girls wash a floor until a man comes to say they get the big tub today, though the women don\\'t usually get that kind of work-\"that\\'s frog work,\" as Lin says. As Sen dumps her pail out the garden door, she sees the silent spirit from the bridge standing outside in the rain looking in. She asks if he\\'s getting wet and leaves the door open for him; he follows her in.\\n\\nThey discover that the big tub is encrusted with crud and will need to be soaked before they can clean it properly, so Lin sends Sen to the foreman (voice: John Ratzenberger) for an herbal soap token. Far above in her apartment, Yubaba senses something approaching. She looks out and wonders who is slinking around in the rain. A spirit that looks like a pile of mud is making its way toward the bathhouse.\\n\\nThe foreman refuses to give Sen a soap token, but the silent spirit liberates one for her. As they fill the big tub to soak it clean, Lin says the water contains salts that are supposed to be good for you. The silent spirit (voice: Bob Bergen again) approaches Sen and offers a handful of soap tokens. (He\\'s not completely silent; in this scene he makes little \"ah ah\" sounds, as if he\\'s trying to talk.) When she politely turns them down, he seems disappointed and lets the tokens fall to the floor. She\\'s distracted when the big tub overflows.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Yubaba has identified the walking mudpile as a stink spirit, though she\\'s suspicious that he isn\\'t really. The staff fails to fend him off, so Yubaba assigns Sen to take him to the big tub and bathe him. Sen can hardly speak because he smells so bad. He\\'s surrounded by a pool of purple stinkiness. He gets in the big tub, which overflows with his brownish slime.\\n\\nYubaba and the foreman watch as Sen tries to clean the stink spirit. She uses the silent spirit\\'s herbal soap tokens to order up some good, cleansing hot water. As Lin arrives to help, Sen feels something like a thorn in the stink spirit\\'s side. Yubaba decides this is important and gives Sen rope to tie to the thorn (which has a handle); with help from all the staff, they pull a bicycle out of the spirit\\'s body, followed by an entire junkyard. (Hayao Miyazaki has said that this part of the story is autobiographical-he once pulled a bicycle out of a polluted, litter-clogged river.) When the slime clears, an ancient-looking brown face with shaggy eyebrows appears and says \"well done\" to Sen. He seems to disappear, leaving her with a handful of something greenish. Then he explodes out of the tub like a giant white snake-or perhaps a dragon (he resembles Haku\\'s dragon form)-and flies away, leaving lots of gold behind. Yubaba is delighted. The guest was a river spirit in distress, not a stink spirit. Sen sees the silent spirit sitting in the corner, apart from all the excitement.\\n\\nAt bedtime, Lin and Sen sit on their balcony eating dumplings. When Sen asks about Haku, Lin says the word is he does Yubaba\\'s dirty work. They watch a train go by on the water. (Or so it seems; with all the rain, the water has risen so it just covers the tracks.) Lin says she has to get out of that place-\"someday I\\'m getting on that train.\" Sen tastes the green stuff the river spirit gave her, but finds it very unpleasant.\\n\\nThat night, the frog who first saw Chihiro on the bridge goes into the room with the big tub and meets the silent spirit, who lures him closer with little gold nuggets. The spirit eats the frog, and thereafter uses his voice. He asks another employee for food and pays with more gold, which seems to grow in his hands as needed.\\n\\nSen takes the river spirit\\'s gift to the piggery, thinking it might turn her porky parents human, but she can\\'t tell which pigs are her parents.\\n\\nBack at the bathhouse, Lin shows Sen a lump of gold from \"a new guest here who\\'s loaded.\" The formerly silent spirit is eating everything the staff can bring him, growing larger and uglier, and dispensing gold. Sen goes to look for Haku.\\n\\nA white dragon that Sen recognizes as Haku flies across the water, lands with a splash, and then seems to be attacked by white birds. Sen opens her balcony doors so the dragon can fly into her room and closes the doors on the birds, which turn out to be made of paper.\\n\\nThe dragon is bleeding, but flies out and up to a higher window. Sen, worried, goes after him; one of the paper birds attaches itself to her back. She runs into the formerly silent spirit, who is glad to see her and offers her gold; she declines and the spirit, disappointed again, drops the gold, which is eagerly snatched up by the other employees. The spirit eats the staffer who was conducting him through the halls and another employee. Has Sen\\'s rejection of his gifts turned him evil?\\n\\nSen finds herself climbing up the outside of the towering bathhouse. She notices that she has some of Haku\\'s blood on her hand. The paper bird moves from her back to her hair; Sen turns to see the Yubaba-bird flying back into her rooms at the top of the bathhouse. Sen tries to get in through a window; the paper bird slips through and unlocks it for her. She goes through a bathroom down a hall to a playroom, where the paper bird enables her to hear Yubaba, who complains into the phone that the problem guest is a no-face spirit who\\'s eating people and that Haku is bleeding all over the carpet. She callously tells someone to \"get him out of here-he\\'ll be dead soon anyway.\" Yubaba comes to the playroom (where Sen is still hiding) and digs through the cushions to find the big baby. When Yubaba leaves, the baby, Bôh, grabs Sen and accuses her of being a germ from outside, come to make him sick. (He never leaves his room so he won\\'t get sick.) He threatens to break her arm if she won\\'t play with him, so she shows him Haku\\'s blood on her hand-\"germs!\"-and he lets go.\\n\\nSen goes out to the main room, where Haku lies bleeding in dragon form. Bôh follows and again demands that Sen play with him. The paper bird turns into a woman who looks just like Yubaba. She turns the baby into a mouse when he mistakes her for his mother. She also turns the smaller Yubaba-bird into a tiny, bug-like bird and turns the three green heads into a facsimile of the big baby.\\n\\nThe woman explains she\\'s Zeniba (voice: Suzanne Pleshette again), Yubaba\\'s twin sister. She says Haku stole her magical golden seal, and she wants it back. The seal carries a curse that Zeniba says will kill anyone who steals it. She says he\\'s a thief-he not only took Zeniba\\'s seal, but plans to steal Yubaba\\'s magic as well. Haku snaps his tail and shreds the paper bird, which is lying on the rug; this action slices Zeniba in half from top to bottom. \"Oh ho, a paper cut,\" she remarks as she falls apart.\\n\\nHaku and Sen fall through a hole in the hearth down a long shaft, almost landing among some evil-looking spirits before Haku, still in dragon form, revives enough to fly them to the boiler room. Once there, Haku collapses; he\\'s still bleeding. Kamajii says it looks serious-he seems to be bleeding from the inside. Sen makes him eat part of the river spirit\\'s gift. He thrashes and struggles and spits up Zeniba\\'s gold seal and a black slug, which Sen steps on and kills. Haku changes back to human form, but he\\'s still ill and unconscious. Sen takes the seal.\\n\\nKamajii says Haku, like Chihiro, appeared at the bathhouse out of nowhere and became pale-faced and steely-eyed once Yubaba took him as her apprentice and got control of him. He thinks Zeniba might be able to help if Sen asks, though Zeniba is very dangerous; Sen agrees. She says Haku helped her, and now she wants to help him. \"I guess my parents will have to wait,\" she says a little glumly.\\n\\nLin comes to say that the silent spirit is a monster called No-face who has swallowed three people; Sen admits that she let him in, though Lin implies she\\'ll get in big trouble for it. Kamajii gives Sen train tickets-a rare treasure-to go to Zeniba\\'s house at Swamp Bottom. He says the train only runs one way now, though it used to go in both directions; Sen will have to walk back along the tracks. When Lin wonders what\\'s going on with Sen and Haku, Kamajii says \"Something you wouldn\\'t recognize. It\\'s called love.\" Meanwhile, No-face is calling for Sen. Yubaba tells Sen to get every last bit of gold out of No-face, who has grown huge and bloated, before evicting him from the bathhouse. Before Sen goes in to see No-face, Yubaba asks \"what\\'s that dirty mouse doing here?\"-she doesn\\'t recognize the mouse as her baby.\\n\\nNo-face offers Sen gold again, confiding, \"I\\'m not giving it to anybody else.\" She tells him she wants to leave because she has somewhere important to go, and that he should leave too because Yubaba doesn\\'t want him in the bathhouse. She asks if he has somewhere to go. He doesn\\'t; he complains that he\\'s lonely. No-face says he wants Sen-meaning he wants to eat her. She makes him eat the remainder of the river spirit\\'s gift instead, and it causes him to vomit uncontrollably (on Yubaba, at one point). Sen runs away and gets him to follow her down many flights of stairs.\\n\\nAt the foot of the stairs, No-face coughs up a couple of the people he ate (who seem fine), and says \"I\\'ll get you for this, Sen.\" He shrinks down to his original size. Lin turns up in a tub-like boat to take Sen to the train station. Sen calls No-face to follow her to the train, saying he needs to get out of the bathhouse because it\\'s making him crazy. She\\'s sure he won\\'t hurt them. No-face coughs up the frog, who swims away.\\n\\nThe train comes; Sen and No-face go aboard, Sen presents their tickets to the conductor, and they ride to Swamp Bottom, where Zeniba lives. Many of the passengers are transparent, and No-face has reverted to transparency as well. The mouse (formerly the baby) and the bug-bird are with them. The train travels over a landscape that\\'s nearly all water.\\n\\nIn the boiler room, Haku wakes up and wakes Kamajii, who explains that Sen has gone to Zeniba\\'s and that she broke Zeniba\\'s spell and cured him with the power of pure love.\\n\\nIn Yubaba\\'s room, the faux big baby (actually the three green heads) is eating while Yubaba sits nearby with some of No-face\\'s gold. Haku comes in and says that something precious to her has been replaced; when Yubaba looks closely, the baby turns back to the three heads and the gold turns to dirt.\\n\\nHaku says, \"the baby is with your sister.\" Yubaba asks what he wants to get the baby back. Yubaba must tear up Sen\\'s contract and return her with both parents to the human world, Haku replies. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test. \"If she fails, she\\'s mine!\"\\n\\nSen and No-face get off the train and go looking for Zeniba. There\\'s a dry path to walk on. The bug-bird and the mouse take turns carrying each other but get tired, so Sen lets them ride on her shoulder. A hopping lamppost leads them through the dark to Zeniba\\'s house. The door opens and Zeniba brusquely invites them in. Zeniba still looks just like Yubaba. She invites them to sit while she makes tea. Sen gives back the golden seal and apologizes for Haku. Zeniba says \"he sliced me in two, you know, and I\\'m still angry.\" Sen thinks she\\'s talking about the slug, which she admits to having squashed, but Zeniba says the slug was how Yubaba controlled Haku. Only love could have broken Zeniba\\'s spell.\\n\\nZeniba says the spell on the mouse and the bug-bird wore off long ago and they can change back whenever they want. They\\'re busy with a spinning wheel, however, and show no interest in changing.\\n\\nZeniba says Sen must help her parents on her own; to do that, she must remember where she first met Haku. She asks Sen to call her Granny. (Zeniba has become quite kindly.) No-face spins and the mouse and bug-bird knit a hair-tie for Sen; Zeniba says it will protect her because her friends made it for her.\\n\\nThe door rattles and Zeniba tells Sen to let in another guest: it\\'s Haku in dragon form. Zeniba says she\\'ll forgive Haku if he takes care of Sen. Zeniba asks No-face to stay with her-\"I need a good helper\"-and No-face agrees. Sen tells Granny her real name, climbs on Haku\\'s back with the mouse and bug-bird, and they fly off. As they fly, she remembers dropping her shoe in a river when she was very small, going in after it and fearing she would drown, but the river carried her to shore. It was the Kohaku River. Haku is the Kohaku River spirit, and can\\'t find his way home because the river has been filled in. Haku changes from dragon to human, and for a while they enjoy free fall.\\n\\nSen and Haku fly in human form, landing at the bathhouse bridge. The mouse turns back to a baby, who speaks up on Sen\\'s behalf. Yubaba wants to give Sen the final test, though the baby objects, but Sen agrees that \"a deal\\'s a deal.\"\\n\\nThe test: Sen must pick out her parents from a crowd of pigs. \"You get one try; if you get it right you can all go home.\" Sen says none of the pigs are her parents; she passes the test and her contract evaporates out of Yubaba\\'s hand. Saying \"thanks for everything, Granny\" (which surprises Yubaba, because she never asked to be called Granny), Sen runs off with Haku, who tells her her parents are on the other side of the river. She has to cross the riverbed and not look back until she\\'s through the tunnel. He\\'ll go back to Yubaba, though no longer in her thrall because he knows his name again. He promises that he and Sen will meet again. Sen-now Chihiro-hears her parents calling and rejoins them near the tunnel mouth; they\\'re fine and don\\'t remember any of what happened. They scold her mildly for running off.\\n\\nWhen they get back to their car, it\\'s dusty and covered with leaves, as though it had been there for a long time. As they drive away, Dad says \"a new home and new school-it is a bit scary.\" Chihiro, much matured since her last car ride, replies, \"I think I can handle it.\"', 'In 2002, Meilin \"Mei\" Lee is a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian girl living in Toronto. She helps take care of the family\\'s temple dedicated to their ancestor, Sun Yee, and works to make her strict, overprotective mother Ming proud. Mei hides her personal interests from Ming, such as the fact that she and her best friends Miriam, Priya, and Abby are fans of the boy band 4*Town. When Ming discovers Mei\\'s crush on the local convenience store clerk, she unintentionally embarrasses Mei in public, including in front of school bully Tyler.\\n\\nMei has a vivid nightmare involving red pandas; when she wakes up in the morning, Mei has transformed into a large red panda. She hides from her parents and discovers that she only transforms when she is in a state of high emotion, though her hair remains red. Ming initially believes Mei is experiencing her first period, but finds out the truth when she further embarrasses Mei at school, causing Mei to transform and run home.\\n\\nMing and Mei\\'s father Jin explain that Sun Yee was granted this transformation to protect her daughters, and every female family member since then has also transformed when they came of age. This has become inconvenient and dangerous in the modern age, so the red panda spirit must be sealed in a talisman by a ritual on the night of the Red Moon; the next being in a month\\'s time. Mei\\'s friends discover her transformation but take a liking to it, and Mei finds that concentrating on them helps control the red panda within her.\\n\\nMing allows Mei to resume her normal life but refuses to let Mei attend 4*Town\\'s upcoming concert. Instead, the girls secretly raise money for the tickets at school, exploiting the popularity of Mei\\'s red panda form, while lying to Ming. To cover the last ticket, Mei agrees to attend Tyler\\'s birthday party as the red panda. At the party, Mei is upset to discover that the concert will be held on her ritual night. In the midst of her rage, she attacks Tyler when he insults her family, frightening the other children. Ming discovers Mei\\'s activities and accuses her friends of corrupting and taking advantage of her. Ashamed and afraid to stand up to her mother, Mei fails to come to her friends\\' defense.\\n\\nMei\\'s grandmother Wu and Mei\\'s aunts come to assist in her ritual, to Ming\\'s dismay. As Mei prepares herself, Jin finds videos she took of herself as the red panda with her friends and tells her she should not be ashamed of this side of her. During the ritual, as Mei\\'s red panda form is about to be sealed, she decides to keep her powers and abandons the ritual to attend the concert at the SkyDome. Her friends forgive her for her actions at the party, and they discover Tyler is also a 4*Town fan. However, during Mei\\'s escape from the temple, Ming becomes so enraged that her amulet breaks and she transforms into a kaiju-sized red panda and disrupts the concert, intending to take Mei back by force.\\n\\nMei and Ming argue about Mei\\'s independence, and as they quarrel, Mei accidentally knocks her mother unconscious. Wu and the other aunts break their talismans to use their red panda forms to help drag Ming into a new ritual circle. Mei\\'s friends and 4*Town join in singing to complete the ritual, sending Mei, Ming, and the other women to the astral plane. Mei reconciles with Ming and helps her mend her bond with Wu, whom Ming accidentally scarred in anger at some point before sealing her red panda form years ago. The other women conceal their red pandas in new talismans, but Mei decides to keep hers, and Ming accepts that she is finding her own path. Later, as the Lee family raises money to repair the damage caused at the SkyDome, Mei and Ming\\'s relationship has improved, as Mei balances her temple duties-where her red panda is now an attraction-with spending time with her friends and Tyler.', 'No Synopsis', 'In Los Angeles, California, in a world of humans and anthropomorphic animals co-existing, The Bad Guys, a gang of notorious, criminal animals led by the cool-headed Mr. Wolf and known for their brazen thefts while eluding the authorities, attempt to steal the Golden Dolphin award from guinea pig philanthropist Professor Rupert Marmalade IV after being insulted by Governor Diane Foxington on-air. During the heist, Wolf inadvertently helps an old woman he intended to pickpocket and is praised for the good deed, leading to Wolf finding himself affected by his wrongdoings and Marmalade\\'s speech about goodness. After the gang are exposed and arrested, Wolf then persuades Marmalade to instead attempt to reform them, planning to take advantage of the pretense to try to steal his award again. Marmalade invites the Bad Guys to his home, but his lessons prove a frustrating struggle with them seemingly unable to adapt to the concept of good behavior.\\n\\nEventually, Marmalade\\'s idea of having them go on a rescue mission, \"a heist for good,\" to save laboratory guinea pigs proves a fiasco from second-in-command Mr. Snake\\'s temptation with eating guinea pigs. Foxington decides to call off the experiment, but relents when Wolf confesses that he despairs being hated for his species. Foxington admits that she understands and confesses that she has hope for him. Wolf contemplates the matter and finds himself rescuing a cat from a tree, which Marmalade records and releases as a viral video. The resulting publicity turns the public image of the Bad Guys around, as the cynical Snake suspects he is losing touch with his friend.\\n\\nWhen the Bad Guys execute a new heist at the grand gala, planned in celebration, Wolf cannot bring himself to finish the plan and betray the newfound trust he earned. However, a rare heart-shaped meteor is stolen framing the Bad Guys for its theft. When the gang is arrested once again, Marmalade meets them in private and tauntingly reveals that he stole the meteorite, and was disguised as the old lady Wolf saved earlier, to manipulate the gang into taking the blame. As the embittered Bad Guys are taken to the SUCM prison, Wolf explains to his gang that he doesn\\'t want to be a criminal anymore, but a notorious rival criminal, The Crimson Paw, rescues them, revealing herself to be Foxington, a reformed criminal herself.\\n\\nUpon reaching safety, the Bad Guys bitterly abandon Wolf for betraying them, but are aghast when they return to their hideout and find it completely emptied of their loot, as Wolf revealed its location to Foxington as compensation for his crimes. The Bad Guys are despondent enough for Snake to give his last possession to the childish Mr. Shark, making the rest of the Bad Guys realize that they can change their ways and help Wolf, but Snake denies that it represented any change of heart before abandoning them himself. Meanwhile, Wolf and Foxington break into Marmalade\\'s home to steal the meteorite, only to be captured by Marmalade, who reveals that Snake has allied with him and brags how he intends to use the meteor\\'s power to control an army of guinea pigs to rob the city. However, the two are rescued by the remainder of the Bad Guys and take the meteorite in an attempt to stop Marmalade\\'s plan.\\n\\nIn the resulting battle, the Bad Guys managed to stop the robberies but they decide to get Snake back despite his betrayal. During the attempt, Marmalade turns on Snake and the Bad Guys risk their lives to save him, bargaining with Marmalade for his safety. After rescuing Snake, the Bad Guys foil Marmalade\\'s plan and surrenders themselves to the authorities. Marmalade attempts to take credit for recovering the meteorite, but the meteor is revealed to be a disguised lamp planted by a secretly-redeemed Snake, who pulls off the masterstroke of his undercover plan to help Wolf by destroying the actual meteorite, outsmarting a shocked Marmalade. Marmalade is also framed as the Crimson Paw, completely destroying his reputation, and leading him to be arrested for his crimes.\\n\\nA year later, the Bad Guys are released from prison in light of their good behavior, partnering up with Foxington as they begin their new crime-fighting careers.', 'The movie begins with two announcers, Bob Cutlass (voice of Bob Costas) and Darrell Cartrip (Darrell Waltrip) preparing for the opening of the Dinoco 400, the final race in the Piston Cup Series, the most famous and prestigious race in the United States. So far this racing season, three racers have emerged as the most likely candidates for the Piston Cup Championship, all three of them tied for the season point\\'s lead-\\n\\n* #43 Strip Weathers, AKA \"The King\" (Richard Petty; modeled after one of the Petty\\'s real 1970 Plymouth Superbirds), a longtime racing veteran who already has seven Piston Cups to his credit and is rumored to be retiring at the end of the current season.\\n\\n*#86 Chick Hicks, another veteran racer (a 1980s Buick Regal, voiced by Michael Keaton) and a longtime \"second banana;\" he\\'s spent his entire racing career coming in second behind The King.\\n\\n*#95 Lightning McQueen, a rookie (standard stock car, voiced by Owen Wilson) This is his first year in the racing circuit and his performance has been nothing short of incredible. Speculation is that he might be the first driver to win the Piston Cup, Rookie of the Year, and Dinoco sponsorship in one sweep.\\n\\nNow, the final race of the season- to decide the winner of the Piston Cup- is about to begin!\\n\\nAs the race proceeds, Hicks (who is clearly willing to do anything to succeed) sideswipes another car- causing the inevitable multicar pileup. Lightning is barely able to dart through the wreckage and keep up with the lead cars. Then, to cement his hold on the lead, McQueen stays out on the lead lap while everyone else pits. The commentators mention that McQueen has recently fired his third crew chief, offering the explanation that Lightning prefers to work alone.\\n\\nThroughout the race, Lightning refuses to make complete pit stops- taking only a few seconds each lap to refuel. The strategy backfires on the last lap when his tires explode. McQueen makes a valiant effort to get across the line first, but the race ends in an absolute dead heat.\\n\\nReporters interview Lightning while the judges argue over the result. McQueen repeats again that he is a \"one-man show.\" His pit crew, fed up with Lightning\\'s shoddy treatment, quit in the middle of the interview. Chick and Lightning trade insults until The King comes over to have a word with Lightning. The King tells McQueen that his talent is extraordinary, but his attitude is stupid- Lightning can\\'t win without a good team behind him. Lightning\\'s idea of a good team is Dinoco, the most prestigious sponsor on the racing circuit (and The Kings\\' current sponsor; Lightning is certain that if he wins the Piston Cup he will be offered the chance at a Dinoco sponsorship.)\\n\\nAn announcement regarding the outcome of the race comes over the loudspeakers. Officials declare that a tiebreaker race (between Chick, Lightning and The King) will be held in California next week to determine the championship.\\n\\nLightning meets with his transporter, Mack (a 1980 Mack Super-Liner truck, voiced by John Ratzenberger) after the announcement. Mack reminds McQueen that he needs to make a personal appearance for his sponsor, Rust-Eze. Lightning films a commercial for Rust-Eze and talks to a group of rusted out vehicles brought to the personal appearance by Rusty & Dusty, heads of the company (voiced by Car Talk hosts and brothers Tom & Ray Magliozzi respectively). McQueen forcibly puts on a good face for the crowd but is obviously unhappy working for a small-time group.\\n\\nOn the road with Mack, Lightning is desperate to be the first competitor to arrive at California. He refuses to let Mack stop off and rest, forcing him to drive on through the night. While on Interstate 40, Mack is confronted by a gang of street racers while he is drowsy, who force him onto the shoulder. The vibration from the rumble strips (designed to alert drowsy drivers that they are drifting off the road) accidentally causes a Lightning figurine to land on the button that opens the back door of the truck, and causes the sleeping Lightning to fall out. Lightning, terrified about being lost, desperately rushes to try and find Mack but ends up leaving the highway at the next exit and following a semi that he thinks is Mack but turns out to be a Peterbilt, who rudely tells McQueen to turn on his headlights.\\n\\nWhile Lightning is speeding, he gets lost in the dark country roads. He passes a police car (Michael Wallis) waiting in a speed trap, who pulls out and chases after Lightning. Lightning pedals for it when he hears the police car backfiring (thinking he is being shot at). Lightning loses control, spinning wildly and becoming entangled in several power lines. He tears through a small town and ends up shredding a large gash down the main street before finally coming to a stop in front of the Sheriff.\\n\\nThe next morning, Mack arrives at the track alone and a huge manhunt begins to try and find Lightning McQueen.\\n\\nLightning wakes up in an impound lot strapped with a parking boot and confronted by a rusted tow truck named Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). Mater tells Lightning that he is in the town of Radiator Springs, a spot just off old U.S. Route 66. The Sheriff shows up to take Lightning to court for his actions.\\n\\nThe other citizens of Radiator Springs- Fillmore (George Carlin), who owns a shop selling his own organic fuel; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) and Guido (Guido Quaroni), who run a tire shop; Ramone (Cheech Marin), who runs a paint and body shop; Flo (Jenifer Lewis), who runs a gas station/cafe; Sarge (Paul Dooley), a Humvee who sells surplus; Lizzie (Katherine Helmond), an antiques dealer; and Red (Joe Ranft), the town\\'s fire truck - have all turned out to demand punishment for Lightning\\'s reckless driving, which caused a large amount of damage to the town.\\n\\nThe town\\'s physician and judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), arrives to try McQueen\\'s case. At first, Doc is ready to impose serious hard time on the culprit but upon getting a close look at Lightning orders him thrown out of town. A female interrupts the judge\\'s rulings, and Lightning is immediately smitten. But the newcomer, Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), a 2002 Porsche 911, is the town\\'s attorney. Sally persuades Doc to sentence Lightning to community service and repair the damage to the road. Doc relents, telling Lightning that he will be set free once the road is finished (which at his estimate should take five days).\\n\\nWhen Mater brings out Bessie, a massive asphalt paving machine, Lightning makes a break for it as soon as his parking boot is undone, leaving Mater to quip that he should have undone the boot after Lightning was hooked up. But Lightning only makes it a few miles out of town before he breaks down. Sally & the Sheriff catch up with him and laugh at his attempt, explaining that they have siphoned Lightning\\'s gas tank.\\n\\nThe townsfolk watch as Lightning begins repaving the road. Lightning tries to convince them of his fame in the hopes of being set free. He almost convinces Luigi by mentioning his status as a racecar, but Luigi loses interest soon after when it turns out he only cares about meeting a real Formula One racecar.\\n\\nLightning, remembering the deal (he goes free when the road is done) hauls the paving machine at full throttle, running down the road and creating an uneven and bumpy finish. The townspeople are insulted by his attitude and his work. Doc challenges Lightning to a race- if Lightning wins, he goes off free. If Doc wins, Lightning has to scape off the current layer of pavement and do the road all over again. Lightning accepts, not seeing the Doc as a threat.\\n\\nAt a dirt course on the outskirts, Lightning rockets off the starting line, but Doc doesn\\'t even move. As he speeds into the first turn of the course, Lightning\\'s tires fail on the dirt and he crashes. Doc wins by default. Lightning reluctantly turns to work at scraping up the pavement, grumbling the whole time. Several of the townsfolk offer Lightning their services (Luigi sells tires, Fillmore supplies organic fuel, Ramone offers custom paintjobs, etc.) but Lightning is too frustrated with his situation to accept anything from them.\\n\\nBy the next morning, Doc finds that the road is about 1/3 finished. Doc meets with the Sheriff, who confirms that Lightning ran out of asphalt while working and spent the rest of the night trying to make the turn that caused him to wreck the day before. Doc confronts Lightning, suggesting that he \"turn right to go left.\" Lightning, extremely skeptical, tries it, but it backfires and sends him back over the edge of the cliff.\\n\\nLightning resumes repaving the road when he suffers a slow leak in one tire. Guido begins to fix it, and Luigi explains that Guido dreams of working at a real racetrack pit stop. Sally, impressed by Lightning\\'s work and his effect on the town, offers Lightning a place at the Cozy Cone motel rather than another night at the impound. Lightning can\\'t resist the opportunity to refuse.\\n\\nThe Sheriff places Mater in charge of watching Lightning for the next night. Mater takes McQueen out to a remote field, where they go tractor-tipping, which involves creeping up to a tractor while it is sleeping, then startling it, which causes the tractor to rear up on its back wheels. Mater gives a demonstration of it, but is unable to tip more than one tractor at a time. Lightning revs his engine and causes every single tractor to tip over. They are almost caught by Frank, the huge threshing machine who oversees the tractors, and have to speed away.\\n\\nOn the way back to town, Mater shows off his skills as \"world\\'s best backwards driver\" - a talent that stuns Lightning. Mater proclaims Lightning to be his \"best friend,\" and Lightning seems to be genuinely touched by the affection.\\n\\nThe next morning, Lightning waits at Doc\\'s garage to get his daily gas ration. While waiting, he wanders into a dusty workshop belonging to Doc and finds several Piston Cup trophies on the floor, and racing memorabilia. A newspaper on the floor answers Lightning\\'s question- Doc is actually the legendary Hudson Hornet, a legendary racecar who still holds the record for most wins in a single season (27 in 1952 alone). But Doc refuses to talk about his racing career. To him, the trophies are \"just a bunch of empty cups.\"\\n\\nSally takes Lightning on a tour of the surrounding landmarks and explains the history of the town. Route 66 used to be the main transportation road, and Radiator Springs was once a famous stop along U.S. Route 66. Radiator Springs was bypassed when Interstate 40 was constructed in favor of saving ten minutes of travel time. Now the once thriving town is floundering; almost nobody comes through there anymore.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Lightning and Mater\\'s actions of the previous night cause trouble when the tractors start stampeding through the town. As he helps round them back up, Lightning spots Doc on the race course outside of town. Doc speeds through, easily making the turn Lightning couldn\\'t. McQueen confronts Doc about his racing and why (if he\\'s so talented) Doc didn\\'t continue his racing career.\\n\\nDoc finally comes clean: He didn\\'t quit, but the organization forced him into retirement after a terrible wreck forced him to sit out an entire season. When he had the chance to return, the sponsors passed him over to a hotshot rookie just like McQueen.\\n\\nThe next day everyone wakes up to find the road has been finished. Lightning now has his chance to leave, but instead chooses to stay behind and accept the services of the townsfolk - including new fuel from Fillmore, tires from Luigi and a new paint scheme from Ramone. As the town celebrates into the night over the completion of their new road, a swarm of reporters and media vehicles swarm in to reclaim McQueen. Before he can explain anything or talk to any of the townsfolk, Lightning is loaded back onto Mack and sent off to California. Sally learns that Doc was the one who alerted the media to Lightning\\'s location and is furious at his actions.\\n\\nLightning arrives in California and begins preparing for the big race, with Mack serving as his pit crew. The King and Chick Hicks get off to a decent start, but Lightning\\'s memories of Sally and his time in Radiator Springs are interfering with his performance and cause him to lose time.\\n\\nAs McQueen tries to pull himself together, Doc\\'s voice comes out on McQueen\\'s radio. He and most of the other Radiator Springs residents have come to encourage Lightning and serve as his pit crew, with Doc serving as crew chief and decked out in his old paint scheme. Cameras in the crowd spot Doc and recognize the legendary Hudson Hornet has come out of retirement.\\n\\nLightning rockets out of the pit area, desperate to catch up to the others. As the laps wind down, Chick makes contact with Lightning and causes him to spin out. But moments later, Chick is surprised when Lightning zooms passes him, driving backwards. Hicks then tries to force McQueen off the road-causing Lightning to blow a tire. Guido prepares for Lightning\\'s arrival, then completes the fastest pit stop in Piston Cup history by speed-changing all four tires in under four seconds single-handed, shocking the forklifts on Chick\\'s pit crew such that they drop their mustache-shaped grilles. Guido proudly tells off Chick\\'s crew saying \"Peet stop!\"\\n\\nThe three racers are down to the last lap as Lightning pulls into first place. Chick smashes Lightning once again, sending him careening off the track. Lightning, however, takes the lead by turning his tires hard to the right while sliding left and reclaims the lead position.\\n\\nChick, in a desperate attempt to win, sideswipes The King, sending him flipping multiple times through the air and landing, heavily battered and damaged on the infield. Lightning screeches to a halt when he sees the King\\'s state, remembering what happened to Doc. Since Lightning stopped just before the finish line, Chick Hicks speeds across for first place. Lightning goes back and pushes the King the rest of the way to the finish line, letting the famous competitor finish his last race with dignity. Lightning tells the King that the Piston is \"Just an empty cup,\" echoing Doc\\'s sentiments.\\n\\nChick Hicks is given the Piston Cup. However, he is jeered and taunted by the crowd for his actions, making it a hollow victory at best.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Lightning is cheered and congratulated for his act of good sportsmanship. Tex, head of the Dinoco company, offers Lightning a sponsorship because of his fine job. Lightning considers, but decides to stay with Rust-Eze because they gave him his big chance.\\n\\nGuido and Luigi are dumbfounded when an actual Ferrari shows up at their store, because McQueen said it is the best place in the world to get tires. Lightning McQueen moves back to Radiator Springs and decides to place his headquarters in the town, making the location famous once more and having the maps redrawn as \"Historic Route 66.\"\\n\\nA series of scenes during the credits show what happens to Radiator Springs afterwards:\\n\\n* Flo\\'s V8 café is seen full of customers, while customers try Ramone\\'s body art.\\n\\n* A museum of Doc Hudson\\'s racing days opens. We see The King and his wife (who is appropriately voiced by the late Lynda Petty), as well as fellow racecar Junior (voiced by Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and modeled after Earnhardt\\'s #8 Chevrolet Monte Carlo) in there.\\n\\n*Sarge opens a boot camp for off-road vehicles (who have never been off-road), and orders a Hummer who protests about getting dirty to drop and give him 20 miles.\\n\\n*In a touch of poetic justice, the street racers who were responsible for McQueen\\'s dilemma are caught by Sheriff speeding near Radiator Springs. They are locked into an impound lot and are sentenced to towing Bessie.\\n\\n*The Radiator Springs Drive-In Movie Theater opens, and shows car versions of popular Pixar movies, including Toy Car Story, Monster Trucks, Inc., and A Bug\\'s Life. The in-joke shown is that Mack is praising Hamm the piggy truck, the Abominable Snowplow, and P.T. Flea - all of whom are voiced by John Ratzenburger, like Mack. When Mack realizes this, he wonders what kind of cut-rate production this is to reuse his voice.', 'No Synopsis', 'In the town of Bunnyburrow, 9 year old bunny, Judy Hopps (Della Saba) is performing in a school play. Her theme explains that animals, once primitive and wild, have now evolved to where predators and prey can live side by side in harmony. The founding mammal city, Zootopia, is hailed as a place where anyone can be anything. Judy then announces that she wants to be a police officer. A kid fox in the audience, Gideon Grey (Phil Johnston), sneers at the idea and even Judy\\'s parents, Bonnie and Stu (Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake) tell her that there\\'s never been a bunny officer. However, Judy is willing to try against all odds. When Judy sees Gideon bullying some kids by taking their fair tickets she boldly confronts him, but Gideon responds by taunting Judy\\'s dreams and slashing her in the face. He leaves and, though she\\'s hurt, Judy shows her friends the tickets she got back and declares that she doesn\\'t know when to quit.\\n\\nYears later Judy attends the Zootopia Police Academy. Judy is tiny compared to the other recruits and faces difficulties managing the obstacle courses run by the drill sergeant (Fuschia!). But through sheer determination, and by using her wits, Judy makes it to graduation as valedictorian. Zootopia Mayor Lionheart (J.K. Simmons) oversees the ceremony and Assistant Mayor Bellwether (Jenny Slate), a sheep, formally congratulates Judy as the first bunny police officer, saying it\\'s a big day for all small animals. She is assigned to Precinct 1 in the heart of Zootopia, much to the apprehension of her parents.\\n\\nA few days after, Judy, her parents, and many siblings head to the train station. Stu convinces Judy to take a can of fox repellent with her before she gets on the train to Zootopia. Judy listens to a hit by pop singer, Gazelle (Shakira), as she zooms through the diverse districts of the city, from the frozen tundra to the sultry rainforest. She finds her apartment, a run-down single room with a rickety bed, paper-thin walls, and two noisy neighbors, Bucky and Pronk Oryx-Antlerson (Byron Howard and Jared Bush). Despite this, she\\'s all to excited for her first day. She gets up bright and early and makes it to the police station where she is directed to role call by the pudgy desk sergeant, a cheetah named Benjamin Clawhauser (Nate Torrence). All the other officers (elephants, rhinos, hippos, and bears) tower over Judy. Police Chief Bogo (Idris Elba) calls them to order and explains their first priority is handling the case of fourteen missing animals; all predators. Bogo divides everyone into teams but assigns Judy to parking duty.\\n\\nJudy is disappointed but sets her standards high and uses her sharp ears to help her write 200 tickets before noon. Around then, she notices a fox who appears to be up to something enter a local ice cream shop run by Jerry Jumbeaux Jr. (John DiMaggio). Though suspicious at first, Judy then sees the fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), is just trying to purchase a jumbo-pop for his son who is wearing an elephant costume. Jerry refuses service to the fox with sneering bigotry and this angers Judy who steps in and proposes a compromise; she\\'ll let the elephants off with a warning for the health code violation of serving ice cream without gloves on their trunks if Nick can have a jumbo-pop. When Nick confesses he doesn\\'t have his wallet, and apologizes to his son for the worst birthday, Judy goes further and pays for the treat. She tells Nick she can\\'t stand it when people are mistreated for being predators or prey and walks away with a spring in her step, happy to have helped someone in need.\\n\\nLater that day, Judy is writing more tickets when she notices the little fox in his elephant suit. She approaches to say hello but then notices that he and Nick are melting the jumbo-pop from the roof of a building and letting the drippings collect in large jars. They drive away together, with the little fox at the wheel. Judy follows them into Tundratown and sees them making mini pops with the melted juice. They take them into the Savannah District and sell them to hamsters coming out of work. The hamsters chomp on the pops and leave the sticks in a recycling bin. The little fox collects the sticks and he and Nick take them to a construction zone in Little Rodentia where they\\'re sold as lumber. Later, Nick and his \\'son\\', a full-grown fennec fox named Finnick (Tom Lister Jr.), part ways and Judy confronts Nick. Nick doesn\\'t deny that he\\'s a hustler but provides Judy with all the paperwork he needs to make his endeavors technically legal and humbles her by saying that the city is not a magical land where dreams come true and a meter maid can never be a real cop.\\n\\nJudy returns to her apartment, sullen, and bears through an inadvertently insulting call from her parents who are thoughtlessly relieved to see she is not a \"real cop\" in their eyes and has instead the safest job on the force. The next day, Judy is writing more tickets and enduring unending verbal abuse from the citizenry for her duty when she is approached by a frantic pig (Josh Dallas) who tells her he\\'s just been robbed. Judy springs into action and chases the thieving weasel (Alan Tudyk) through the city square and into Little Rodentia. During the chase, in which Judy has to take considerable pains to avoid accidental harm to the tiny citizenry and their property, Duke kicks a plastic doughnut from a shop toward Judy and it nearly crushes a lady shrew, but Judy stops it in the nick of time and uses the doughnut to apprehend the weasel. Judy rolls him into the station but is called to Bogo\\'s office. He reprimands her for leaving her post and endangering the public to retrieve a bag of moldy onions. Judy objects, saying that the \\'onions\\' are actually flower bulbs called Midnicampum holicithias and that she only wanted to serve as a real cop. However, Chief Bogo responds that she had her orders as a parking attendant and disobeyed them, making a political appointee like her intolerable to him.\\n\\nJust then, an otter named Mrs. Otterton (Octavia Spencer) barges in, begging Chief Bogo to find her husband, Emmitt, who has been missing for ten days. Bogo offers empty assurances until Judy steps up and promises to find him. Bogo escorts Mrs. Otterton out of the office before firing Judy for insubordination. However, when he opens the door again, he finds Mrs. Otterton speaking with Assistant Mayor Bellwether who promptly sends a notice to the mayor about Judy\\'s willingness to take the case and tells Judy to come to her for any assistance. Bogo reluctantly allows Judy to take the case but gives her a 48 hour ultimatum; she finds the otter or resigns. Judy agrees.\\n\\nAt the front desk, Clawhauser gives Judy the case file but there are no leads or witnesses and, since she\\'s new, she has no technological resources. However, Judy notices in the lone photograph they have that Emmitt is eating a familiar looking popsicle. She locates Nick on the streets and demands his help but he refuses. When she says his ten dollars\\' worth of mini pops can wait, he claims to have made two hundred a day since he was twelve. Judy records Nick on her carrot pen recorder and puts his own words against his tax files which show he\\'s claimed zero income. Judy says she\\'ll report him for tax evasion, a federal offense, unless he helps her. Finnick, who was asleep in the stroller Nick was pushing, laughs at the reverse hustle and wishes Nick good luck working with the fuzz before walking off.\\n\\nNick takes Judy to Mystic Springs Oasis, the last place he saw Otterton going. They\\'re met by a yak named Yax (Tommy Chong), doing yoga behind a desk. He recognizes Mr. Otterton but says he hasn\\'t seen him in a couple of weeks. He then takes them into the oasis to find Emmitt\\'s yoga instructor, an elephant named Nangi (Gita Reddy), and Judy is shocked to find the oasis is a haven for naturalists; nude animals. Nangi has no memory of Otterton, but Yax unwittingly gives Judy all the information she needs, including the plate number for the car Otterton was picked up in the last time he was there. Nick says he has a friend at the DMV who can help them run the plate number. There, Judy is disheartened to see that the DMV is run solely by sloths. Nick\\'s friend, Flash (Raymond S. Persi) is able to run the plate number for them but, naturally, takes forever to do so. This isn\\'t helped when Nick, in an attempt to push Judy\\'s buttons, delays them with a joke. By the time they exit, it\\'s nighttime.\\n\\nJudy finds out the car in question is a limo in Tundratown but, by the time she and Nick arrive, the lot\\'s closed. Without a warrant, Judy cannot get in. Defeated, she holds out her recording pen to Nick but flings it over the fence. Nick goes to retrieve it and Judy meets him on the other side, slyly saying that she doesn\\'t need a warrant if she has probable cause - and a shifty-looking fox climbing over the gate qualifies. They locate the limo and search it, finding polar bear fur, claw marks all over the back seat, and Otterton\\'s wallet. Then, Nick recognizes an insignia on a drinking glass and panics; he knows who\\'s car this is. When they open the car door to leave they\\'re confronted by a couple of polar bears who shove them into a car.\\n\\nSqueezed in the back seat between two polar bears, Nick explains that the car belongs to a thug boss named Mr. Big with whom he\\'s not on good terms because Nick sold him an expensive rug made from the fur of a skunk\\'s butt. Nick and Judy are brought into a study where Mr. Big (Maurice LaMarche), a shrew, is carried in by his polar bear guards. He berates Nick for tarnishing his trust and the hospitality of his grandmother who he recently buried in the skunk rug, and scolds him for returning on the day of his daughter\\'s wedding. Unafraid, Judy steps forward and tells Mr. Big that she knows Emmitt Otterton was with him last and will find out what happened to him if it\\'s the last thing she does. Unfazed, Mr. Big orders his bears to \\'ice\\' Nick and Judy and they\\'re held over a trap door in the floor that reveals icy water. Mr. Big\\'s daughter, Fru Fru (Leah Latham), then walks in wearing her wedding dress and recognizes Judy as the bunny that saved her the previous day from being crushed by the doughnut. In gratitude, Mr. Big releases Judy and Nick and invites them to Fru Fru\\'s wedding reception where he explains that Otterton was his florist but, before meeting with him to discuss something important, went crazy in the limo he sent, attacked his driver, and disappeared. Mr. Big directs them to speak with the driver, Manchas (Jesse Corti), in the Rainforest District for more information.\\n\\nManchas, a melanistic jaguar, cracks open the door when Nick and Judy arrive, showing scratches all over his face and acting fearful. He tells them that Otterton kept talking about the \\'night howlers\\' before he went wild and savagely attacked him. Nick says they\\'re there to talk about the night howlers too and Manchas agrees to let them in but, just after he unlocks the chain, Judy and Nick hear him groan followed by a thud. They push the door open to see Manchas on all fours, growling viciously at them. Nick and Judy run for their lives, pursued closely by Manchas. Judy manages to call for backup as she and Nick tumble and fall through the slick canopy. Finally, Judy is able to cuff Manchas to a light pole near a gondola station and throws herself and Nick off it into some vines away from the jaguar\\'s claws. They meet up with the responding police units and Judy explains to Chief Bogo that she believes Manchas, like Otterton, went \\'savage\\'. However, when she takes them back to the gondola station, Manchas is gone. Bogo, irritated and not believing Judy\\'s story demands her to hand over her badge for failing to complete her assignment, but Nick stands up for Judy. He says that Bogo gave them 48 hours, which means they have ten left to find Otterton. He takes Judy onto a gondola and they leave.\\n\\nOver the rainforest, Nick explains that he was idealistic like Judy once. As a kid, he wanted nothing more than to join the Junior Ranger Scouts. His mother bought him a new uniform and he was excited to become part of the group, despite the fact that he was the only predator to join. Upon arriving, however, the other animals bullied and muzzled him, saying that he was stupid for thinking they\\'d trust a fox. After that day he decided he would never let anyone see that they had gotten to him and if people only thought of foxes as shifty and untrustworthy, then that\\'s what he would be. Judy consoles him but Nick deflects from her affections by looking at traffic below. He then realizes that there are traffic cameras all over the canopy and they can use them to find out where Manchas was taken.\\n\\nJudy recalls that Assistant Mayor Bellwether offered to help them. They meet her at City Hall and she takes them to her office which is nothing more than a janitor\\'s closet. Despite her upbeat personality, it\\'s no secret that she\\'s woefully mistreated by the Mayor. She opens the database for the Rainforest District traffic cameras before being called away by Lionheart. Judy and Nick find the footage of Manchas and see that he was netted and hauled away by timber wolves. Judy realizes that the wolves must be the Night Howlers. They watch as the wolves\\' van drives through a tunnel but fails to come out the other side. Nick says that there\\'s a maintenance tunnel and, if he were to do anything illegal, that\\'s the route he\\'d take to avoid observation. They relocate the van and go to where it was headed - an old building outside of town called Cliffside Asylum. Nick and Judy make it past the guards by inciting a group howl; something the wolves can\\'t resist. Inside, they find new equipment in an old hospital ward. Following claw marks on the floor, they find fifteen cells inhabited by various predators, all feral and savage, including Manchas and Mr. Otterton.\\n\\nJudy realizes she\\'s just found all of the missing mammals but, just then, Mayor Lionheart enters with a badger doctor (Katie Lowes). Judy and Nick hide in an empty cell and Judy records Lionheart as he demands to know why predators are going savage. The doctor has no answer and says that they must come forward to Chief Bogo but the Mayor refuses, saying his reputation as a predator official is at stake. At that moment, Judy\\'s phone rings with a call from her parents. Lionheart is startled and the doctor orders security to investigate before locking off the wing. Nick and Judy escape by flushing themselves down a toilet just before the guards arrive and they manage to get the evidence Judy recorded back to Bogo.\\n\\nThe ZPD arrive at the asylum and place everyone, including the Mayor, under arrest. Lionheart protests that they still don\\'t know why predators are going savage and he was trying to protect the public. Later, Chief Bogo, deeply impressed at Hopp\\'s achievement, holds a press conference where Judy gives Nick her pen recorder and offers him the chance to sign up as her partner. Nick is flattered and watches as Judy is called to the stand to answer some questions. Judy starts simple, mentioning that all the savage mammals are predators, but when pressed as to why, she speculates that it could be something to do with their DNA. As predators, the inflicted may have reverted back to their primal origins. The reporters go into a frenzy before Bellwether shuts down the conference. Judy is relieved to be off the podium but Nick is angered by what she said. Judy says she was just stating facts but Nick asks her if a fox such as himself should indeed be trusted. When he raises his arms, asking if Judy is afraid of him, she instinctively puts her hand on her fox repellent. He hands her back the application, telling her that it\\'s best she doesn\\'t have a predator for a partner, before leaving.\\n\\nA wedge is driven between the predator and prey populations, with prey acting fearful against all predators. Gazelle hosts a peaceful protest against discrimination, despite backlash, and savage attacks continue in the city as more predators go primal. Judy feels responsible for the ensuing tensions between the animals and goes to see Mrs. Otterton where she\\'s watching Emmitt meander mindlessly in his hospital room. At the police station, Judy is summoned by Bogo to see the new mayor, Bellwether. Bellwether explains that with the population in Zootopia being 90% prey, she wants Judy as the face of the ZPD to inspire hope. But Judy claims that she\\'s no hero and says she\\'s done the opposite of what she wanted; to make the world a better place. She says a good cop should help the city, not tear it apart, and hands over her badge before leaving.\\n\\nJudy returns to Bunnyburrow where she manages her parent\\'s vegetable stand. She wonders aloud to them how she ever thought she could make a difference but they console her as a pie truck pulls up. As the driver, a grown Gideon Grey, gets out, Judy\\'s parents explain that they\\'ve partnered up with him and never would have done so had Judy not opened their eyes. Gideon apologizes to Judy for what he did when he was younger, stating that his own insecurities manifested into unchecked rage, but Judy forgives him and says she knows a thing or two about being a jerk. Just then, some bunny children run through the field behind them and Judy\\'s father warns them to stay away from the growing Midnicampum holicithias near the edge. Gideon laughs and says his family just called them night howlers. Judy perks up at this and her father explains that the flowers keep away pests but are toxic. His brother Terry ate one and went into a rage, biting Judy\\'s mother. Judy realizes that the night howlers weren\\'t the wolves - they were flowers. Not only that, but they make animals go savage.\\n\\nShe grabs the keys to the truck and races back to Zootopia. She finds Finnick and he points her to Nick, sitting in the sun beside a small bridge. Judy runs up to him and reveals the truth about the night howlers but he walks away. Desperate, Judy apologizes to him and says she needs his help. She begins to cry and admits that she was a jerk to him and really is a dumb bunny as he once said. Nick doesn\\'t seem to react until he replays a recording of her repentance and holds up her pen recorder enabling that and smiles, saying he\\'ll erase it after 48 hours, before embracing a profoundly relieved Judy. They climb into the truck and Nick helps himself to some of Judy\\'s blueberries while she shows him a picture of the weasel thief she caught stealing the Midnicampum holicithias; Duke Weaselton. They find him on a street corner selling bootleg DVDs such as \\'Wrangled\\', \\'Pig Hero 6\\', and \\'Meowana\\'. Judy confronts him and demands to know what he was doing with the night howler flower bulbs, but he says he won\\'t talk. Judy and Nick smile slyly and take the weasel to Mr. Big. Duke is incredulous as to why Mr. Big would help a cop, but Mr. Big smiles and says Judy is the godmother of his future grandchild. A very pregnant Fru Fru says she\\'s going to name her daughter after Judy. On threat of being iced, Duke relents and confesses he sold bulbs to a ram named Doug who works out of an abandoned rail station.\\n\\nNick and Judy follow the directions to a rusty subway car underground. They sneak inside and find Doug (Rich Moore) in a yellow jumpsuit preparing the blue flowers and harvesting them chemically to produce a serum which he puts into fragile pellets. He loads a pellet into a gun as his phone rings, telling him his next mark is a cheetah in Sahara Square. He assures the caller he can make the hit since he was able to get an otter in a moving car. He places the gun in a briefcase and goes to answer a knock at the back of the car, saying that Woolter and Jesse have come back with coffee. Judy takes the opportunity to knock Doug out of the car and locks the door before ordering Nick to get the car moving. With some finagling, they\\'re able to start it and the car moves down the track, slowly gaining speed. Judy is intent on bringing the evidence to police headquarters but two rams jump onto the moving car. They manage to knock Jesse off the car inside the tunnel, grazing him as he hugs the wall and shaving his belly pink. Woolter head-butts his way into the front of the car as they make their way outside but they soon face another oncoming train. Judy tells Nick to speed up and kicks Woolter into a switch lever just in time, but they are traveling too fast around the next curve and the car derails into the next empty station. Judy and Nick jump from the car as the friction causes it to go up in flames and watch from the platform as it explodes. Judy thinks all the evidence is destroyed but Nick holds up the briefcase with the gun inside.\\n\\nThey run upstairs out of the station and into the Natural History Museum, empty due to renovations. As they near the exit toward the police station they are called from behind by Mayor Bellwether, accompanied by two rams in police uniform. Bellwether thanks Judy for discovering the perpetrators behind the predator conspiracy and reaches for the briefcase but Judy wonders aloud how she knew where to find them. They edge toward the exit but are blocked by a disheveled Woolter. Realizing Bellwether was behind the plot all along, Judy and Nick run and attempt to hide down a corridor. Along the way Judy runs into a protruding mammoth tusk and cuts her leg. Nick pulls a handkerchief out of his pocket, blueberries spilling everywhere, and bandages Judy\\'s leg but she tells him to leave her since she can\\'t walk. They try to think of something as they are surrounded by the sheep.\\n\\nBellwether calls out to Judy, saying that in the city prey outnumber predators 10 to 1. They need to band together to end their mistreatment against the more powerful and loud predators and, once united, will be unstoppable. Judy and Nick run for it but are knocked into a sunken diorama and Nick drops the briefcase. Bellwether retrieves it and looks down on Nick and Judy before taking aim with the gun and shooting Nick. The blue solution covers his neck and he trembles while Bellwether calls the police and feigns alarm, saying Officer Judy is down and being attacked by a savage fox. Judy tells Bellwether her plan won\\'t work as Nick advances on her, growling. Bellwether says that fear always works and, with a predisposition to savagery, predators will be forced out of Zootopia and she\\'ll dart every one to keep it that way.\\n\\nNick then lunges at Judy and puts his jaws around her neck, but just as quickly releases her as Judy puts on a dramatic performance. Nick and Judy then reveal they switched out the serum in the gun with blueberries and have recorded everything Bellwether said on Judy\\'s pen recorder. Horrified, Bellwether backs up to flee only to be stopped and arrested by the responding ZPD.\\n\\nOn the news, an anchor reads that Bellwether was charged for masterminding the savage predator conspiracy. Former Mayor Lionheart gives an interview where he says he didn\\'t know about Bellwether\\'s plot and only caged the savage predators to protect the city, citing he did a wrong thing for the right reasons. It is announced that an antidote has been created with positive effects. Judy goes to the hospital where she sees Emmitt Otterton recovering and embracing his concerned wife.\\n\\nMonths later, Judy, a police officer again and much wizened by her experience, addresses the new police academy graduates, one of them being Nick Wilde. She says, \"When I was a kid, I thought Zootopia was this perfect place where everyone got along and anyone could be anything. Turns out, real life\\'s a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker. Real life is messy. We all have limitations. We all make mistakes, which means...hey, glass half full! We all have a lot in common. And the more we try to understand one another, the more exceptional each of us will be. But we have to try. No matter what type of animal you are, from the biggest elephant to our first fox, I implore you: Try. Try to make a difference. Try to make the world a better place. Try to look inside yourself and recognize that change starts with you. It starts with me. It starts with all of us.\"\\n\\nNick approaches the stage and Judy pins on his cop badge. The next day, Chief Bogo hands out assignments, giving Nick and Judy the task of catching a hot-rodder tearing up the roads downtown. Judy and Nick come across the speeder in their patrol car and pull him over, surprised to see Flash the sloth behind the wheel. Flash smiles slyly at Nick and the credits roll as Gazelle (Shakira) performs \\'Try Everything\\' at a concert in Zootopia with everyone in attendance save for Bellwether who watches the show on TV from prison.', 'Using a tapa cloth to animate her story, Gramma Tala (Rachel House) tells a group of young children the story of the mother island Te Fiti. With her heart, Te Fiti possesses the power to create life and brings other islands into existence. However, other beings desired the power of her heart but only one was daring enough to take it. The demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson), using his magical fish hook to shape shift into various creatures, travels to the mother island and steals Te Fiti\\'s heart; a small, green gemstone engraved with a spiral. Without her heart, Te Fiti\\'s island begins to deteriorate and sends forth a terrible darkness. Maui escapes on his boat but is confronted by Te Ka, a demon of lava and fire which rose from the sea like a volcano. Maui boldly engaged Te Ka in battle but was struck from the sky, losing both his hook and Te Fiti\\'s heart to the sea.\\n\\nGramma Tala finishes her story saying that, a thousand years later, Te Ka and other monsters still hunt for the heart while the darkness continues to spread until, one day, it will consume their island. At this, most of the children either cry or faint, but one girl is spellbound. Gramma Tala then says that, one day, someone will find the heart, journey beyond the island\\'s reef, find Maui, and take him to restore the heart and save everyone.\\n\\nAt that moment Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison), the little girl\\'s father, enters and tells the children that there is no darkness or monsters and they are safe on their island as long as they stay within the reef. However, he accidentally hits a post that reveals multiple cloth paintings of monsters, sending the children into a panic. In the chaos the little girl, Moana (Louise Bush), slips away and goes down to the water. She sees a seashell wash up on shore and goes to collect it when she notices a baby sea turtle being menaced by a group of frigate birds. Leaving the shell, Moana shields the turtle with a large leaf and guides it to the water\\'s edge. Once it\\'s safe, a rippling effect washes over the surface of the ocean and the water recedes, revealing a trail of beautiful seashells which Moana gathers in her tiny arms.\\n\\nWithin the canyon of water and surrounded by sea life and coral, a wave forms over Moana\\'s head and looks curiously down at her. It plays with her, splashing her and tying her hair in a topknot. Then, in the water, Moana sees a shiny object drifting toward her. She plucks the glowing green stone from the water and trails her finger over the spiral design. Just then, her father calls for her and the ocean returns her to shore on a piece of driftwood, but Moana drops the stone. Before she can find it, Chief Tui picks her up and takes her back to the village along with her mother, Sina (Nicole Scherzinger). She tells Moana that she\\'ll do wondrous things as the future chief.\\n\\nGrowing up, Moana learns everything she needs to know about life on her island, Motonui (song: \"Where You Are\"), but she finds herself continuously drawn to the ocean. Every time she goes near it, her parents bring her back and remind her that to her duties and her people are where she belongs; not the sea. Her grandmother, Tala, however, encourages Moana to follow her heart and listen to the \\'voice inside\\'; for that is who she truly is. Chief Tui then takes Moana, now grown, to the sacred peak of their island and shows her a tall pile of flattened stones which he and his forefathers placed to raise the island higher. One day, he says, Moana will place her own stone on the peak.\\n\\nMoana grows into her role as chief in training despite her inner wish to go to the sea and makes her rounds on the island: she fixes a leaking roof, provides support to a man getting a tattoo, and teaches children hula dancing. An elderly man points out a rooster named Heihei (Alan Tudyk) pecking and attempting to eat a rock and wonders if he should be eaten, but Moana says that, in some cases, one\\'s strength is hidden beneath the surface. Then, a woman shows Moana and her parents that the coconut harvest has yielded blackened, rotten fruit. Moana chooses a new location to plant a grove but then a group of fisherman show the chief that their haul of fish has brought in nothing, despite changing their fishing rounds. Moana suggests fishing beyond the reef, but the notion angers her father who storms off.\\n\\nSina goes to Moana and explains to her that Tui\\'s reservation against the ocean comes from his youth when he took a boat to sea and was wrecked in a storm. His friend, who had begged to go, drowned. Tui doesn\\'t want the same thing to happen to Moana but Sina tells her that she must make her own choices, however hard they are.\\n\\nConflicted over her duties to her village and her dream to sail the sea (song: \"How Far I\\'ll Go\"), Moana ultimately decides to finally take a canoe out to see if she can find any fish beyond the reef and takes her pet pig, Pua, with her. At first it seems she can sail with ease, but a wave knocks her canoe sideways and sends Pua overboard. Distracted, Moana fails to see another wave rise above her and flip her canoe over. Moana is submerged and gets her foot trapped within some coral but manages to free herself by smashing it with a rock. She makes it to shore, exhausted, and find Pua scared, but alive. Gramma Tala then walks up joking that whatever transpired should be blamed on the pig. Moana tries to hide her bruised ankle, but Tala isn\\'t fooled and takes a look. However, she promises not to tell Moana\\'s father.\\n\\nMoana says that Tui was right about going out there. She tells Tala that she\\'s going to put her stone on the pile. Tala doesn\\'t argue and goes to the water to dance with a school of manta rays, saying that when she dies she\\'ll come back as one, or else she chose the wrong tattoo. Curious as to why her grandmother isn\\'t contradicting her, Moana asks if there\\'s something she wants to tell her.\\n\\nTala takes Moana to a holed up cavern where, after removing some rocks, Moana finds a passageway. Tala says that Moana has heard all their people\\'s stories but one. She tells her to follow the tunnel and bang the drum to find the answer to the question that\\'s bothered her all her life: who is she meant to be?\\n\\nMoana follows Tala\\'s instructions and finds a small fleet of boats and canoes hidden in the cavern behind a massive waterfall. She bangs the drum on the largest ship and sees a vision of her ancestors within the tapa sail. It reveals that they were voyagers who sailed the ocean finding new islands to inhabit (song: \"We Know The Way\"). Thrilled, Moana asks Tala why they stopped voyaging. Tala explains that when Maui stole the heart of Te Fiti and unleashed the darkness it made sailing too treacherous; boats stopped coming back. To save themselves, Moana\\'s ancestors hid away their boats and decided to remain on Motonui. Tala then shows Moana a portion of their island which appears to have the very life from it being drained to sea. She then tells Moana that her stories were true; that someone will one day restore the heart and save everyone. Then, she presses a green stone into Moana\\'s hand that she\\'d kept within her necklace, saying that she was there the day the ocean chose Moana to be the one to restore the heart. The ocean then rises up and playfully splashes Moana who was stunned to find out that the memory wasn\\'t just a dream as she thought.\\n\\nTala shows Moana a constellation of an enormous hook, saying that Maui will be beneath it. Moana laments that she doesn\\'t know how to sail but realizes she knows who does. She runs to the master hut where Tui is addressing the council, trying to assure them they won\\'t run out of food. When Moana interrupts and begs help to restore the heart, Tui leaves in anger and says he should have burned the boats in the cavern ages ago. He takes the stone from Moana\\'s hand, saying it\\'s merely a rock, and throws it into the bushes. When Moana retrieves it, she finds her grandmother\\'s walking stick. Just then, a warrior calls to the chief. Tui and Moana run to their hut to find Tala lying in bed, unwell. Whispering, she tells Moana to take the heart and find Maui. She gives her the necklace to hold the heart in and tells Moana she\\'ll always be with her. Moana leaves and her mother helps her pack. From the cavern, Moana takes the small canoe with a spiral painted on the sail. Once on the water, Moana looks back and sees her grandmother\\'s spirit in the form of a manta ray flying toward her. It illuminates safe passage for her and Moana makes it to the sea.\\n\\nShe struggles to sail properly, following the hook constellation, and even discovers that Heihei has stowed away. One night Moana\\'s canoe capsizes just before a storm hits and Moana is washed up on a rocky island. Angry that the ocean didn\\'t help her when she asked, Moana is still relieved that she didn\\'t lose the heart of Te Fiti. Then, she notices hook-shaped marks dotting the rocks on the island and realizes that the ocean has delivered her to Maui. She ducks behind her canoe as Maui approaches, preparing herself, but Maui easily lifts the canoe with one hand, excited to see a boat. Moana confronts him but Maui interrupts and begins boasting about all his exploits (song: \"You\\'re Welcome\"), using his Mini-Maui tattoo to show off his accomplishments displayed as numerous tattoos all over his body. Maui tricks Moana and traps her in the cave he lived in while he plans to commandeer her canoe, despite protests from Mini-Maui. Moana escapes the cave and jumps into the ocean as Maui sails away. Moana tries to catch up and is assisted by the ocean which deposits her quickly onto her canoe. Despite repeatedly throwing her overboard, Moana is returned to the boat by the ocean and she demands of Maui that he help her restore the heart.\\n\\nMaui tries to throw the heart away but the ocean throws it back at him. Then he tries to swim away, but the ocean puts him back. He claims that the stone is not a \\'heart\\' but rather a curse that lost him his hook and that bad things are always trying to find it. At that moment, a spear lands on the boat, just missing Heihei. Behind them a massive object moves out of the fog. Maui recognizes the small coconut creatures and their large ship as Kakamora - tiny, mischievous pirates. Moana begs the ocean to help them, but Maui tells her that the ocean doesn\\'t help; they help themselves. He is shocked to find out Moana can\\'t sail and does all he can to evade the Kakamora, but they latch onto Moana\\'s canoe with their spears and board the craft. They knock Moana down and the heart falls out of her necklace. Heihei gobbles it up but the Kakamora steal him. Maui tries to escape but Moana takes the oar and goes after Heihei. She manages to retrieve him in a flurry of paralyzing blow darts and zip-lines herself back to her canoe. She and Maui just barely escape as the Kakamora\\'s boats collide into each other.\\n\\nAfterward, Maui is still hesitant to return the heart but Moana convinces him by saying that he would be restored to the hero he once was. She agrees to help him retrieve his hook before setting a course for Te Fiti and then asks him to teach her to sail. At first Maui refuses, but the ocean uses a leftover blow dart to paralyze Maui, forcing him to tell Moana what to do. He shows her how to wayfind, using celestial navigation. They make their way to a tall, rocky spire in the middle of the ocean. At the top is the entrance to Lalotai; the realm of monsters. Maui opens the entrance and he and Moana drop into the realm. Moana evades an array of monsters and eventually finds the entrance to the lair of Tamatoa, a creature Maui said would have his hook since he loves to collect shiny and valuable objects.\\n\\nUsing her as bait, Maui sends Moana into the lair where Tamatoa captures her. While Maui sneaks up from behind, Moana distracts Tamatoa by inciting him to brag about himself and Tamatoa obliges (song: \"Shiny\"). Maui then takes his hook and attempts to shapeshift, but it\\'s been so long that he can\\'t control his powers. Tamatoa places Moana in a cage and focuses on Maui as he finishes his song. Then, Moana uses some bioluminescent algae to create a false heart of Te Fiti and distracts Tamatoa with it while she and Maui escape. Using a geyser, Maui and Moana are shot back to the surface.\\n\\nBack on top, Maui is sincere for once, humbled by the fact that he can\\'t shapeshift. On the canoe, he tells Moana that they have no chance of defeating Te Ka, even with his hook back. Moana then asks him about a tattoo on his back that he noticed earlier but Maui is hesitant to talk about it. After some persistence, he gives in and tells Moana he earns his tattoos which show up magically. The one on his back was his first; he was born to human parents but they didn\\'t want him and threw him into the sea. The gods took pity on him and made him the demigod Maui, giving him his fish hook. But Moana tells him that it\\'s not the gods who make him Maui - it\\'s him. With this renewed confidence, Maui tries shapeshifting again, starting small, and this time is able to control his powers.\\n\\nHe teaches Moana how to sail properly and, by morning, compliments Moana on her abilities just as they reach Te Fiti. With the island in view, Moana gives Maui the heart and wishes him luck. He shifts into a hawk and flies toward the island but Te Ka rises up to confront him. Maui is knocked out of the sky once more and retreats to the canoe. Moana tries to sail past Te Ka despite Maui\\'s protest. Te Ka lunges at them and Maui deflects with his hook but the force sends their canoe hurtling back out to sea. When she comes to, Moana finds Maui brooding over his broken hook. Distraught over this, Maui angrily blames Moana for not listening to him and says that one more hit to his hook will destroy it. He says he\\'s done helping her, transforms into a hawk, and leaves.\\n\\nSaddened, Moana asks the sea why it brought her here and begs it to choose someone else, giving the heart back to it. She breaks down as she watches the heart sink into the depths but then sees a manta ray spirit swimming toward the canoe. Her grandmother appears and offers comfort, saying that if Moana wants to go home, she\\'ll be with her. However, Moana hesitates and realizes that, in her heart, she was meant to do this (song: \"I Am Moana\"). She sees visions of her ancestors and, with their strength, dives into the sea and retrieves the heart. When she surfaces, her ancestors and grandmother are gone but she prepares the canoe, stows Heihei safely in the cargo, and sails back toward Te Fiti.\\n\\nAt the barrier islands, she tricks Te Ka and speeds past the rocks, using the water to her advantage since Te Ka can\\'t touch it. Te Ka then sends a giant wave her way, knocking her canoe over and is about to hit her with a blast of fire but Maui appears and defends Moana, giving her enough time to make it to Te Fiti. When she gets there, however, Moana finds that the entire island of Te Fiti is gone; the shape of the goddess gouged beneath the water all that remains. Turning back, she then notices a spiral symbol on Te Ka\\'s chest and realizes the truth. Holding the heart above her, she grabs the attention of Te Ka before it\\'s able to deal a blow to Maui, who has by now completely lost his hook. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path for Te Ka to reach her and goes to meet Te Ka face to face.\\n\\nMoana tells Te Ka that this is not truly who she is. Te Ka\\'s fires go out as she calms down and Moana places the heart back within the spiral on Te Ka\\'s chest. Restored, the lava rock falls away to reveal Te Fiti, lush and green once more. She returns to her island and takes Moana and Maui in her hand. Maui is apologetic for having taken Te Fiti\\'s heart and the goddess rewards him with a brand new fish hook and gives Moana a new canoe to sail in. Then, the goddess is finally able to rest.\\n\\nMoana asks Maui to come back with her since her people will need a master wayfinder. Maui says they already have one and bids Moana farewell. Moana sails back to Motonui where the flowers and fruit are blossoming again since the darkness has been defeated. She is reunited with her people and her parents. The ocean gives her a pink seashell which Moana places on the sacred mountain before helping her people take the fleet of boats out to begin voyaging once again. She teaches them to sail and wayfind and revels in her new role with her grandmother\\'s manta ray spirit guiding her and Maui flying beside her.', 'No Synopsis', 'The sun rises over the Pride Lands. Animals from all corners of the kingdom head over to Pride Rock (\"Circle of Life\"). The ruling lions King Mufasa (voice of James Earl Jones) and Queen Sarabi (voice of Alfre Woodard) are welcoming the birth of their cub, Simba. The mandrill high priest Rafiki (voice of John Kani) presents Simba before all the animals, and they all bow before the new prince.\\n\\nA little mouse is scurrying around his environment until he comes across the vicious Scar (voice of Chiwetel Ejiofor), Mufasa\\'s jealous brother. Before he can devour the mouse, Scar is interrupted by Mufasa\\'s hornbill major-domo Zazu (voice of John Oliver). He warns Scar that Mufasa is on his way to chastise him for missing out on the ceremony for Simba. Sure enough, Mufasa arrives to confront his brother, just as Scar is trying to make lunch out of Zazu. Scar expresses his dismay for not getting his place on the throne after Mufasa now that Simba is born. After Mufasa and Zazu leave, Scar looks on with scorn.\\n\\nRafiki is by his tree, where he uses several bugs to form a drawing of Simba on the tree.\\n\\nTime passes, and Simba (now voiced by JD McCrary) is an eager and curious little cub. He wakes up his father so that he can explore the Pride Lands. Mufasa explains that everything in the Pride Lands is theirs, but anything beyond the borders is forbidden from venturing into. He also tells his son that they are connected in the great circle of life in regards to his duty as a future king. Zazu then flies in for the morning report before Mufasa teaches Simba how to pounce on the bird. Moments later, Zazu tells Mufasa that he has spotted hyenas. Mufasa orders Simba to go to Sarabi.\\n\\nSimba goes to Scar, who rests alone on his own little rock. As Simba expresses curiosity over what is beyond the borders of the Pride Lands, Scar tells him that it\\'s an elephant graveyard. Simba then goes to find his best friend Nala (voice of Shahadi Wright Joseph), who is in the middle of a bath. Simba gets his own bath from Sarabi before he tells Nala that he wants to go to the watering hole, but Sarabi makes the cubs take Zazu as a chaperon.\\n\\nOn their walk, Simba tells Nala where they are really going. Zazu notices them together and notes how cute it is to see two betrothed cubs together. This grosses out Simba and Nala, who insist they are only friends. Zazu says those are the rules, and Simba says he is going to change some of these rules when he becomes king (\"I Just Can\\'t Wait To Be King\"). The cubs lose Zazu amidst the other animals before they head to the elephant graveyard. While exploring, they are found by a pack of hyenas, led by Shenzi (voice of Florence Kasumba), Kamari (voice of Keegan-Michael Key), and Azizi (voice of Eric Andre). Shenzi is ready to eat them once she realizes who Simba is, even as Zazu flies in to warn her that doing so would start a war with Mufasa. She attacks, but Zazu manages to hold her off long enough for Simba and Nala to run away. The pack then surrounds the cubs. Simba tries to roar at the hyenas but merely musters up simple growls. As they laugh and ask him to do it again, a louder roar is heard. Mufasa runs in and fights off the hyenas before ordering Shenzi to back off or face retribution. The hyenas retreat, but Mufasa is upset at Simba as he takes him and Nala home.\\n\\nMufasa has Zazu take Nala home while he talks to Simba. He expresses his disappointment in him, but Simba tries to defend himself by saying that he was trying to be brave like Mufasa. He tells his son that he\\'s only brave when he needs to be, and that he was afraid of losing Simba. They then sit to look up at the stars, and Mufasa tells Simba that the great kings of the past are looking down on them.\\n\\nThe hyenas return to their hideout, complaining about their lack of food. It is then shown that Scar is leading them, and he deliberately led Simba and Nala to their path. He then tells the hyenas about his plan to kill Mufasa so that he will lead the Pride Lands (\"Be Prepared\"), and this will also mean more food for the hyenas.\\n\\nThe next day, Scar brings Simba by a gorge to practice his roar. After he leaves Simba alone, he gives to hyenas the signal to make their move. Suddenly, Simba looks up at the cliff to notice a WILDEBEEST STAMPEDE. He runs for it and climbs up a tree for safety. Scar finds Mufasa and Zazu, warning his brother about Simba being trapped in the gorge while telling Zazu to alert the lionesses. Mufasa runs through the herd of wildebeest to reach Simba. He brings the cub up to safety but is dragged away by the wildebeest. Mufasa then starts climbing up the hill, only to be caught by Scar, who sinks his claws into Mufasa\\'s paws. With a sinister look in his eyes, Scar tells Mufasa, \"Long live the king\", and he smacks his brother off the cliff to his demise. Simba watches helplessly as his father falls into the stampede. He runs down and discovers Mufasa\\'s body, tearfully pleading with him to wake up. Scar finds Simba and says it\\'s all his fault that his father is dead. Fearing for the consequences, Simba asks Scar what to do, and Scar orders him to run away and never return. After Simba does so, he sends Shenzi, Kamari, and Azizi (plus an unnamed hyena) to chase after Simba and kill him. Simba outruns the hyenas to the edge of a cliff where he and the fourth hyena fall over. Shenzi orders the other two to make sure Simba is dead, but they figure to themselves that he could not have survived the fall, and they are not eager to climb down and check. Simba is seen hiding before continuing his exile.\\n\\nScar announces Mufasa\\'s death to the lionesses, and then says that Simba was also killed. He feigns his grief before walking up to Pride Rock to assume his new duties as king, and then brings the hyenas out. Zazu and Rafiki watch from a distance and mourn Mufasa and Simba.\\n\\nSimba walks alone for miles before ending up in a desert. He collapses in exhaustion before a flock of vultures swoop in to try and eat him. They are interrupted by the meerkat-and-warthog duo Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen), who scare off the vultures before finding Simba. The two decide they should keep the cub so that when he grows into an adult lion, he will be on their side. Simba wakes up and is despondent, still blaming himself for his father\\'s death. Timon and Pumbaa take him in and show him how they live their lives, according to their motto, \"Hakuna Matata\" (It means \"no worries!\"). Since the other animals are friends, Simba can\\'t eat them and now feasts on bugs. He spends more time with Timon and Pumbaa, now growing into an adult (now played by Donald Glover).\\n\\nUnder Scar\\'s reign, the Pride Lands become devoid of sufficient food and resources, since the hyenas are bleeding everything dry. Nala (now voiced by Beyonce Knowles-Carter) expresses concern over how things have turned. Scar even tries to get Sarabi to be his queen, promising that she can dine with him, but she refuses. He then has the hyenas eat the rest of his kill, leaving barely scraps for the lionesses. Later that night, Nala tries to leave Pride Rock, but she is spotted by Zazu, who knows what Scar will do to her if he catches her leaving. Therefore, he creates a diversion to get Scar and the hyenas to chase him, allowing Nala to get away.\\n\\nAfter spending a day chowing down on grubs, Simba, Timon and Pumbaa lay down to look up at the stars. As Timon and Pumbaa muse over what could be up there, Simba mentions what Mufasa once told him about the kings of the past looking down on them. Timon and Pumbaa laugh it off, which bothers Simba. He goes to be alone, and as he lays down, some fur from his mane flies off. It is blown away and goes through a few animals before it finds its way to Rafiki. He senses that Simba is still alive, and he rejoices.\\n\\nTimon and Pumbaa are walking through their home while singing \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" before Nala attacks and chases after them. As they flee, Simba jumps out and pounces on Nala, but after she pins him down, he realizes who it is. Simba is excited to see his best friend again while Nala is elated that Simba is alive. The two go off together to catch up, leaving Timon and Pumbaa to realize that the two lions are becoming more than friends (\"Can You Feel The Love Tonight?\"). However, the happiness is short-lived once Nala tells Simba that he needs to return home due to what Scar and the hyenas have done. Still feeling guilty, he refuses to go back. Nala leaves him when he becomes too stubborn and doesn\\'t listen to her.\\n\\nSimba wanders off alone until he is found by Rafiki. He tells Simba he knows Mufasa, and that he is alive. Simba follows Rafiki and is led to a lake. Rafiki makes Simba see his reflection, which turns into the image of Mufasa. Up in the clouds, Simba sees and hears Mufasa\\'s voice as his face is illuminated by lightning. Mufasa knows that Simba has forgotten who he is, and therefore has forgotten his own father. He tells him to remember that he is the one true king. Now realizing his purpose, Simba runs off to catch up with Nala, and Timon and Pumbaa follow.\\n\\nThe four make it to the Pride Lands and meet with Zazu, who is also happy to see Simba again. They see how bad the land looks, and why it is urgent that they stop Scar. Simba has Timon and Pumbaa be \"live bait\" to distract the hyenas and to let them get to Pride Rock. Simba sees Scar hurting Sarabi when she defies him again. Everyone is stunned to see Simba returning, and he goes by his mother\\'s side. Scar tries to turn the tables on him by making Simba admit his guilt in Mufasa\\'s death. Scar advances toward Simba, causing him to slip and hang over the edge of Pride Rock. Lightning strikes a nearby tree, causing a fire down below. Scar then brags to Simba over how he looks, not realizing he is openly admitting his own guilt for the lionesses to hear. He then whispers to Simba that he killed Mufasa, and Simba pounces on his murderous uncle. Scar confesses to his crime, but then sics the hyenas on the lionesses, beginning an all-out war. The lions battle the hyenas, while Timon, Pumbaa, and Rafiki all get a few good licks in.\\n\\nSimba then goes after Scar, who tries to run away. When Simba confronts him, Scar blames the hyenas and says that he was planning to kill them for their supposed crime. Scar begs Simba for mercy, and Simba orders him to do the same thing he ordered him to do as a cub: run away and never return. Scar seems to agree to the terms, but instead flings hot embers in Simba\\'s face. The two then begin to fight, swinging claws at each other until Simba gains the upper hand and knocks Scar off the edge of the cliff. He survives and sees the hyenas coming toward him. Unfortunately for him, the hyenas heard him throw them under the bus, and they proceed to rip Scar to shreds.\\n\\nThe rain falls over the Pride Lands to wash away the fire. With the hyenas gone, the lionesses gather around Pride Rock. Zazu and Rafiki allow Simba his chance to ascend. He walks to the edge of Pride Rock and hears Mufasa\\'s voice saying, \"Remember.\" With that, he roars before the lionesses to become the new LION KING.\\n\\nThe Pride Lands return to their former glory, looking beautiful and prosperous once more. Timon and Pumbaa have moved in to be close to their friend. Simba and Nala are now king and queen, and Rafiki presents their cub Kiara to the rest of the animals, thereby continuing the circle of life.', 'The movie opens with a TV documentary featuring Chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), the youngest chef in France to receive a five-star rating and owner of the best restaurant in Paris. He\\'s also the author of a bestselling cookbook that proudly bears his mantra, \"Anyone Can Cook!\"\\n\\nA rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt) begins talking about his life in monologue fashion. Remy states that he has enhanced senses of both taste and smell, which makes him very meticulous about what he eats. Remy\\'s brother Emile (Peter Sohn) is impressed by this talent, but their father Django (Brian Dennehy) who leads the rats\\' colony, could care less - until Remy reveals that he can recognize the scent of rat poison in or near food. Django puts Remy to work sniffing and testing food for the rest of the clan. Remy is not happy about the rats having to steal food from the garbage; he would prefer to go to the kitchen and take the \"fresh\" samples. But Django, who hates and fears humans, forbids Remy (and all other members of the clan) to interact with them.\\n\\nDespite his father\\'s orders, Remy spends several nights in the home of an old lady, Mabel, (which is where the rats have colonized), reading Chef Gusteau\\'s cookbook and watching television programs about cooking. Before long he has a near-expert level of knowledge about food preparation. One day, Remy takes Emile into the kitchen to get some spices that will go with some other food samples they have gathered. Emile hesitates, but agrees to go with his brother. While inside, Remy sees Gusteau on TV and listens in, but he learns that a famous food critic named Anton Ego (Peter O\\'Toole), known for having viciously high standards, gave Gusteau\\'s restaurant a less-than-stellar review that resulted in the restaurant losing one of its five stars. A heartbroken Gusteau died soon after, which meant the loss of another star according to tradition.\\n\\nWhile reacting to the news of Gusteau\\'s death, Remy accidentally wakes Mabel, who attempts to kill him and Emile with a shotgun. They manage to evade her, but the roof of the house is shot multiple times and collapses, exposing the entire rat colony. Django orders everyone to evacuate but Remy stays behind to grab Gusteau\\'s book. The rats manage to escape on miniature rafts into a river. Remy uses the cookbook as a flotation device but is separated from the group by a rapid current in the sewers.\\n\\nHours later, Remy sits, reading the cookbook, waiting for a sign of his friends and family. Through a fusion of grief, loneliness and hunger, Remy begins to hallucinate that the illustration of Chef Gusteau is talking to him. Gusteau encourages Remy to go up through the sewers and find out where he is now. Remy travels along several pipes and finds that he is in Paris - just in front of Gusteau\\'s restaurant!\\n\\nInside Gusteau\\'s, the new head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) meets Alfredo Linguini (Lou Romano), the son of Chef Gusteau\\'s recently-deceased old flame, Renata. Linguini gives Skinner a letter written by his mother in the hope of getting a job at the restaurant; He is given the role of plongeur, or garbage-boy, and put to work immediately.\\n\\nAs Remy watches the action in the kitchen, he spots Linguini accidentally knocking over a pot of soup and trying to cover up his error by adding random ingredients. Knowing that the combination Linguini has forged will be terrible, Remy freaks out and accidentally falls into the restaurant through the skylight. He tries to escape through an open window, but catches a whiff of the soup and, revolted by the smell, adds his own ingredients to the mixture. However, inspired by a hallucination of Gusteau, continues to fix the soup, but gets caught by Linguini, who traps him underneath a bowl before he can run away and anybody else notices him. Skinner spots Linguini supposedly messing with the soup and chews him out, but he cannot stop the wait staff from serving the soup. A bowl is served to a food critic, Solene LeClaire, who likes the concoction. Skinner still wants to fire Linguini, but another chef, Colette Tatou (Janeane Garofolo), sticks up for Linguini, stating that firing him for making something a customer liked would go against the restaurant\\'s mantra and heavily affect their reputation for the worst. Skinner relents and allows Linguini to stay.\\n\\nRemy makes another attempt to escape, but this time Skinner spots him and Linguini manages to catch Remy in a jar. Skinner orders Linguini to take the rat away and kill it. Linguini takes Remy to a river but cannot bring himself to dispose of the rat. Linguini knows that the rat was the one who really made the soup and that Skinner will expect a duplication of the recipe. Linguini, seeing that Remy can apparently understand him, takes the rat home and essentially adopts him.\\n\\nThe next morning, Linguini sees that Remy (who he has nicknamed \"Little Chef\") has apparently stolen food and bailed, but in reality has cooked breakfast for them both, which is short-lived when Linguini notices that they\\'re late for their first day. When they arrive at the restaurant, Linguini tries to find a way to have Remy cook but without anyone else seeing. After a few tries, they find out that Remy can manipulate Linguini like a puppet by pulling on the boy\\'s hair. Deciding that this is their best method, Linguini and Remy spend the next few days practicing cooking in their spare time. Before long they are able to make a perfect duplicate of the soup that captured the critic\\'s attention. Skinner appoints Colette to teach Linguini about the finer points of haute cuisine. Colette does not relish the task at first; she\\'s the only female chef, worked very hard to obtain her position and sees Linguini as a possible threat to her status.\\n\\nLater that night Skinner meets with an agent. We learn that since Chef Gusteau\\'s death, Skinner has been making a profit by selling out the Gusteau name and image to a line of cheap frozen food. Taking a moment to read the letter from Linguini\\'s mother, Skinner panics and calls his lawyer. The lawyer (Teddy Newton) explains that Gusteau\\'s will stipulates that if no heir can be found after two years (a deadline which expires in less than a month), Skinner will inherit the restaurant. Apparently the letter from Linguini\\'s mother states that Linguini is Gusteau\\'s son, and should be the rightful heir! Skinner refuses to believe it while the lawyer suggests doing a DNA test as well as a background check.\\n\\nColette begins training Linguini (with Remy also paying rapt attention) about the fine art of cooking, and a rapport develops between the two.\\n\\nOne night, a group of guests, sick of ordering Linguini\\'s soup time and time again, asks the head waiter Mustafa (John Ratzenberger) about what is \"new\". The staff panics, but Skinner decides to have Linguini prepare an old Gusteau-style recipe for sweetbreads. Skinner knows that Gusteau considered that recipe a \"disaster\" and hopes that it will be Linguini\\'s downfall.\\n\\nColette begins to follow the recipe but Linguini (under Remy\\'s manipulations) alters it severely, which angers her. But a few minutes later, Mustafa bursts in and declares that the customers love the new concoction and there are several more orders for it! The other chefs toast Linguini\\'s success later that evening. Skinner, knowing about Remy, brings Linguini into his office and pulls out a bottle of rare \\'61 Château Latour in an attempt to get Linguini to talk about his \"secrets\" but gets nowhere.\\n\\nMeanwhile Remy, resting outside, spots a mysterious figure in the garbage pails. He is stunned to find that it is his brother Emile! Overjoyed, Remy runs inside to steal some ingredients to fix food for his brother. Afterwards, Emile brings Remy to the new colony. Django is overjoyed to find his second son alive, but grows furious when Remy says he wants to leave the colony (and return to Linguini). Remy lets slip that he\\'s \"observed\" humans and has found that they\\'re not as bad as Django made them out to be, but Django, in an attempt to change his mind, brings Remy to a storefront that specializes in rat-killing, stating his belief that humans and rats must always be enemies. Remy, however, feels differently. He leaves the colony and goes back to Linguini.\\n\\nThe next morning, Remy finds Linguini still at the restaurant, exhausted from spending overnight cleaning. He notices Colette pulling in and attempts to hide Linguini\\'s drowsiness with a pair of sunglasses. Colette, annoyed at Linguini for seemingly using her advice to impress and get in closer with Skinner, mistakes his fatigue for snobbishness and slaps him. She confesses to a now-awake and startled Linguini that she thought he was not like the other chefs and had romantic feelings for him, and leaves in a huff. In an attempt to apologize, Linguini tries to confess his secret to Colette, but Remy, desperate to remain hidden, forces Linguini forward so that he ends up kissing Colette. After a few seconds of hesitation, she reciprocates and a relationship between the two is formed.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Anton Ego is in his study when he hears news from his butler of Gusteau\\'s renewed popularity. Stunned, he vows to return there and find out what is truly going on.\\n\\nSkinner\\'s lawyer returns to confirm Skinner\\'s worst fear - Linguini is indeed Gusteau\\'s son. Skinner decides not to tell Linguini and let the will\\'s deadline (a mere 3 days away) pass - after which he can fire Linguini and suffer no ill effects.\\n\\nLater that night, Linguini goes out on a spin with Colette on her motorbike, leaving Remy behind. He finds Emile with a few other rats outside the restaurant. Remy is frustrated that Emile snitched on him, and heads in to get food to keep the other rats from telling the rest of the colony. He sneaks into Skinner\\'s office to find the key to the food locker, and in the process finds and reads the documents describing Linguini\\'s parentage. Remy tries to take the documents, but Skinner spots him escaping again. Despite a thorough chase, Remy gets away and Linguini learns the truth. Skinner is fired, Linguini takes charge of the restaurant and the Gusteau frozen-food line is halted.\\n\\nAt a press conference a few days later, Linguini tries to explain his \"genius\" without exposing Remy, much to the latter\\'s frustration. Anton Ego then walks in and introduces himself to Linguini, promising to come by the restaurant the next night to review Gusteau\\'s once more.\\n\\nAfter the conference, Linguini vents to Remy about how he\\'s inhibiting his focus and, in his growing arrogance, decides to try and work without Remy\\'s help. In anger, Remy arranges for the rest of his rat-clan to raid the restaurant that night. Linguini finds out and throws all the rats out, including Remy, warning him not to come back or else he\\'ll be \"treated the way restaurants are supposed to treat pests\". Remy retreats into the night, dejected.\\n\\nThat evening, Remy is found by Emile near the restaurant observing Linguini\\'s poor leadership. Emile then tries to grab a piece of suspiciously placed cheese, but Remy notices that it\\'s a trap and gets caught trying to save him. It turns out that the trap was set by Skinner, who wants Remy to work for him creating new frozen foods.\\n\\nEgo arrives at the restaurant, and instead of ordering off the menu he challenges the chef to \"hit [him] with your best shot.\" Skinner, eager to see the downfall of Linguini, asks to have the same dish that Ego is served.\\n\\nRemy, still caged, is freed by his father and brother. Thankful, he returns to the restaurant to help Linguini. The chefs spot him returning and try to kill him, but Linguini steps in and protects Remy, confessing the truth to everyone. The chefs, stunned, walk out - even Colette. Linguini retreats to his office believing there to be no hope for Gusteau\\'s.\\n\\nDjango comes in and admits that he was wrong; seeing Linguini stand up for Remy has changed his attitude about humans. Django recruits the entire rat colony to help out - they will follow Remy\\'s orders to prepare the food.\\n\\nJust then, a health inspector arrives and sees the kitchen full of rats. A group of rats led by Django swarms the inspector, tying him up and locking him in the pantry.\\n\\nBefore long, after a thorough cleaning in the kitchen\\'s dishwasher, the rats form an intricate system under Remy\\'s supervision and are preparing all the meals for the restaurant. Linguini, knowing that someone will have to wait tables, puts on a pair of roller skates and begins serving the guests.\\n\\nColette, having had a change of heart, returns to the restaurant to help Remy and Linguini. She asks what Remy wants to prepare for Ego. Remy selects ratatouille, an older-style recipe not traditionally up to the standards of Gusteau\\'s (Colette calls it a \"peasant dish.\") Soon enough, the entrée is prepared and served to Anton Ego.\\n\\nEgo takes a bite of the ratatouille, and immediately has a flashback to his childhood where his mother prepared the same dish to brighten his spirits after a bicycle accident. He is overwhelmed with emotion for the dish. Skinner, furious, storms into the kitchen - and is tied up and thrown into the pantry alongside the health inspector.\\n\\nEgo\\'s heart is warmed by the fantastic meal and insists on thanking the chef, but is told that he must wait until all other customers have left. That evening, Ego learns the whole truth from Linguini, Colette and Remy. After leaving the restaurant, Ego writes a fantastic review for Gusteau\\'s - proclaiming the chef to be \"the finest in Paris\", while neglecting to reveal the chef\\'s true identity.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the good fortune does not last. The health inspector and Skinner are eventually freed, and word gets out about the inner workings of the kitchen which leads to Gusteau\\'s being shut down. Ego loses his job and a great deal of credibility for promoting a rat-infested restaurant.\\n\\nRemy, telling this story to his family and a few friends, states that Ego is now working as a small-business investor. It seems that Ego (along with Colette, Linguini and Remy) has opened a bistro named \"La Ratatouille\" where humans and rats (in a hidden, separate chamber) are both welcome, and Gusteau\\'s legacy lives on.', 'A Scottish man (voiced by Mike Myers) reads a fairy tale from a book:\\n\\n\"Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love\\'s first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon\\'s keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love\\'s first kiss.\"\\n\\n(laughing) A green hand rips the page out of the book. \"Like that\\'s ever gonna happen.\" Cut to an outhouse exterior. The toilet flushes. \"What a load of...\" The door slams open, revealing the man, a green ogre. He sees his house, built into the bottom of a large tree stump, and breathes a happy sigh. He lives a normal life (for an ogre). He undresses and takes a (mud) shower outside. He brushes his teeth (using a caterpillar\\'s guts as toothpaste). He smiles into the mirror (but it cracks as in \"The Munsters\"). He jumps into a pond (and farts). Some dead fish float up, and he grabs one. After he gets dressed, he gets a giant slug out of a hollow log (for his dinner). Finally, he paints a \"BEWARE. OGRE\" sign and posts it.\\n\\nMen burst out of a tavern in the town and plan to capture the ogre for a reward. They grab pitchforks and torches and head for his place. The ogre is eating a bowl of eyeballs. He burps to light his fireplace, swallows the fish, and then relaxes in his easy chair. The men finally arrive at the ogre\\'s house at night. The ogre hears them, and sneaks up behind them. He frightens them by telling them what he could do to them, then he roars and they all flee in fear. The ogre sees a poster on the ground and picks it up: \"WANTED. FAIRY TALE CREATURES. REWARD\". He tosses it back on the ground and walks away.\\n\\nIn the forest, various fairy tale creatures are being loaded into wagons for the rewards: The Seven Dwarfs, a witch, an elf, Pinocchio, The Three Bears, Tinker Bell, etc. A talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) is next in line after Pinocchio (voiced by Cody Cameron). The Captain of the Guards (voiced by Jim Cummings) gives Gepetto (voiced by Chris Miller) five shillings for the \"possessed toy\". The donkey\\'s owner (voiced by Kathleen Freeman) can\\'t get him to talk when asked by the knights, so they drag her away. As she struggles with the knights, she kicks the lantern holding Tinker Bell, and it flies into the air, landing on the donkey and spilling pixie dust on him. He floats into the air. The donkey talks now as he floats away, saying, \"You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, but I bet you aint never seen a donkey fly!\" (copying the crows in \"Dumbo\"). Peter Pan (voiced by Michael Galasso) and the Three Little Pigs (voiced by Cody Cameron) are surprised that he can fly, but the Captain of the Guards is more surprised that he can talk. The pixie dust wears off, and the donkey falls to the ground. The knights try to seize him, but he runs into the forest.\\n\\nThe donkey bumps into the back of the ogre, who was posting a \"KEEP OUT\" poster on a tree. When the knights approach, the donkey hides behind the ogre. The Captain of the Guards announces that Lord Farquaad authorized him to arrest them and transport them to a designated resettlement facility. The ogre says, \"Oh, really. You and what army?\" The Captain looks back and sees that the other knights have run away, so he too runs away, yelling in fear. As the ogre walks away the donkey follows him and compliments him on how great he was with the guards. The donkey says that he doesn\\'t have any friends and asks to stay with the ogre, who then tries to scare him away. The donkey just gives him a compliment on how scary that was and sings. The ogre tells the donkey that he is an ogre, but the donkey doesn\\'t care. The donkey asks for the ogre\\'s name, and he replies, \"Shrek.\" Shrek lets the donkey stay at his house for one night (outside).\\n\\nAs Shrek eats his dinner, he hears a noise and shouts at the donkey to stay outside. He looks back at his table and sees the Three Blind Mice (voiced by Christopher Knights and Simon J. Smith). When he grabs the mice, The Seven Dwarfs push the case with Snow White onto the table. They tell Shrek it\\'s because the bed\\'s taken, and Shrek sees that The Big Bad Wolf is in it. He grabs the wolf and tosses him out, but sees hundreds of fairy tale creatures camped outside his house. Pinocchio and one of the pigs tell Shrek that Lord Farquaad evicted them and put them there. The donkey tells Shrek that he knows where Lord Farquaad is, so Shrek announces that their welcome is worn out, that he will see Farquaad right now so that he can get them all off his swamp and back where they all came from. They all cheer. Shrek tells the donkey that he is coming with him. The donkey is happy and says, \"Shrek and Donkey, on a whirlwind big city adventure.\" Donkey then starts singing \"On The Road Again\", but Shrek makes him hum it instead.\\n\\nIn a castle, the town\\'s lord walks down a hallway. When he reaches the guards at the end, it\\'s obvious that he is a dwarf. He enters the torture chamber where the executioner, Thelonius (voiced by Christopher Knights), is drowning The Gingerbread Man (voiced by Conrad Vernon) in a glass of milk. The lord (voiced by John Lithgow) torments The Gingerbread Man, and then crumbles one of his severed legs. He tells The Gingerbread Man that he and all the other fairy tale trash are monsters that are poisoning his perfect world. He demands that The Gingerbread Man tell him where the others are and starts to tear off one of his gumdrop buttons. The Gingerbread Man then rambles on about The Muffin Man, but they are interrupted by knights who bring in The Evil Queen\\'s Magic Mirror. The lord knocks The Gingerbread Man into a trash can then asks, \"Mirror mirror on the wall, is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?\" The Magic Mirror (voiced by Chris Miller) replies that he is not technically a king yet, but can become one by marrying a princess. The Magic Mirror then presents the eligible bachelorettes, \"Dating Game\" style: Cinderella, Snow White, and Princess Fiona (in the castle guarded by a dragon). Upon prompting by Thelonius, Lord Farquaad picks Princess Fiona. The Magic Mirror then displays Princess Fiona while playing \"Escape (The Piña Colada Song)\". Lord Farquaad says that she\\'s perfect, and that finally he will be the perfect king. The Magic Mirror tries to tell him what happens at night after sunset, but he tells the mirror to be quiet. Lord Farquaad then announces that they are going to have a tournament.\\n\\nShrek and Donkey reach the castle at Duloc. The parking lot is arranged like the one at Disneyland. Shrek remarks that it must be Lord Farquaad\\'s castle. It\\'s extremely tall, and Shrek jokes that he could be compensating for something. As they approach the roped lines for the ticket booth, Shrek tries to talk to Duloc\\'s costumed mascot (voiced by Andrew Adamson), which looks like Lord Farquaad, but he runs away in fear through the lines. Shrek walks straight through the ropes, dragging them along as Donkey follows, and tries to calm the mascot down. The mascot gets knocked out when he runs into the turnstile. Shrek and Donkey go through the turnstile. Elevator music plays in the otherwise quiet and deserted courtyard. The souvenir shop only has Lord Farquaad items. Donkey sees an information booth and pulls the lever. There is some clicking, and then the doors open, revealing music and wooden puppets (like in \"It\\'s a Small World\") that sing the rules for Duloc, \"a perfect place\". The doors shut and a camera takes Shrek and Donkey\\'s picture, then their photo comes out, showing them stunned.\\n\\nShrek and Donkey hear fanfare and go in that direction. Lord Farquaad is high upon a balcony announcing that the tournament winner (champion) will have the privilege to go rescue Princess Fiona. Shrek and Donkey march past the contestants (knights), then Farquaad instead tells the knights that the one who kills the ogre will be named champion. Shrek bursts open a wine barrel to slip up some knights, then slides through the brew, swinging at them with one of their axes like a hockey player. Donkey climbs onto the other barrel and rolls over some more knights. When more knights arrive, Shrek jumps into a corral and fights them like a professional wrestler. After a while, the crowd cheers for Shrek. Donkey joins in, \"tag team\" style, knocking out another knight. After Shrek sits on another knight, a woman (voiced by Jacquie Barnbrook) shouts for Shrek to give \"give him the chair\", so he whacks him over the head with a chair. After Shrek throws the last knight, Donkey kicks him, knocking him out. Shrek hams it up for the crowd. Lord Farquaad signals to the knights with crossbows, but instead of giving the order to kill Shrek, he proclaims that Shrek is the champion. Farquaad tells Shrek that he won the honor to go on the quest. Shrek replies that he is already on a quest to get his swamp back, where Farquaad dumped the fairy tale creatures. Farquaad offers a deal to Shrek that if he goes on this quest, Farquaad will give him his swamp back, with the squatters gone, so Shrek agrees.\\n\\nOn the way to rescue Princess Fiona, Shrek and Donkey pass through various vegetable fields. As Shrek munches on some vegetables, Donkey asks Shrek why he\\'s going to fight a dragon and rescue a princess to get his swamp back, which Farquaad filled with \"freaks\". He tells Shrek that he should act like an ogre, and lay siege to his fortress and grind his bones. Shrek sarcastically suggests that instead he could have decapitated some villagers and drank their fluids. Shrek tells Donkey that there\\'s a lot more to ogres than people think, that they are like onions and have layers.\\n\\nShrek and Donkey pass a run-down windmill. After two days, they finally reach the castle where Princess Fiona is held, up on a mountain. Dried lava and brimstone are everywhere. Donkey thinks the smell is from Shrek, but Shrek tells Donkey that if it were him, Donkey would be dead. They reach a footbridge over a river of lava leading to the castle. Donkey is afraid to cross, but Shrek backs him up, tricking him to cross.\\n\\nInside the castle, Shrek tells Donkey to look for stairs so they can reach Princess Fiona. Shrek puts on some armor of a dead knight. Suddenly, the dragon breathes fire and chases after Donkey. Shrek grabs the dragon\\'s tail, but it shakes him off, sending him flying into Princess Fiona\\'s room and waking her up. Meanwhile, the dragon has Donkey trapped. Donkey complements it on its white teeth, notices that it\\'s a girl dragon, and gives it more appropriate compliments. The dragon picks him up with her teeth and walks happily away. While Shrek recovers, Princess Fiona lies back down on the bed and pretends to sleep. Shrek approaches her but instead of kissing her, he shakes her forcefully and shouts for her to wake up. Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) wants romance, but Shrek keeps his helmet on and drags her down the stairs. Down below, the dragon is cuddling and romancing Donkey. Shrek grabs a hanging chain and swings towards the dragon, but the chain is stuck up above. He shakes it loose, and he falls, knocking Donkey away as the dragon is about to kiss him. The dragon kisses Shrek\\'s naked butt. The chain\\'s frame falls around the dragon\\'s neck like a collar. Shrek and Donkey run away, then Shrek grabs Donkey and Fiona as the dragon chases them, repeatedly breathing fire. They crisscross the castle and the chain tangles around all the pillars. Shrek locks the chain into the floor with a sword. As they run across the bridge the dragon burns half of it up, but they make it safely across. The dragon tries to fly after them, but the chain holds it back.\\n\\nSafely on the other side, Fiona demands that Shrek remove his helmet and kiss her. He removes his helmet, and she is shocked and disappointed that he is an ogre. Shrek tells her that Lord Farquaad sent him, that he\\'s the one who wants to marry her. Princess Fiona tells him in that case that Lord Farquaad should rescue her and she refuses to leave. Shrek picks her up then they head back to Duloc. When Shrek finally sets Fiona down she asks Shrek and Donkey what Duloc and Lord Farquaad are like. Shrek and Donkey start making short jokes about him. She says that they are just jealous of him. When she hears that they will get to Duloc the next day, Fiona gets upset and insists that they make camp immediately. They find a rock cliff, and Princess Fiona sleeps alone in a small enclosure on it. Shrek tells Donkey stories about the stars, and then says that things are more than they appear. Donkey wonders what they will do when they get back to their swamp, but Shrek tells him that it\\'s his swamp, and he is going to build a ten-foot wall around his land. Donkey thinks that Shrek is trying to keep people out, then Shrek shouts at Donkey that he\\'s trying to keep everyone out. Fiona wakes up and slides the door open, then overhears Shrek telling Donkey how people judge him before they even know him, and that\\'s why he\\'s better off alone. Fiona closes the door then Donkey and Shrek talk about the stars again.\\n\\nAt his castle, Lord Farquaad is in bed with a drink and repeatedly makes the Magic Mirror show him the picture of Princess Fiona. He says that she\\'s perfect.\\n\\nThe next morning, Princess Fiona sings with a bird, but it explodes when she hits a high note. She cooks the bird\\'s eggs for breakfast. Fiona tells Shrek and Donkey that she is making it up to them because they got off to a bad start yesterday; after all, they rescued her. As they walk towards Duloc, Shrek burps then Fiona burps too. Suddenly a man (voiced by Vincent Cassel) swinging from a vine grabs Fiona. He calls out for his Merry Men. They all appear, dancing and singing about him, Robin Hood. As he brandishes a knife, Robin Hood finishes the song by saying he will cut out Shrek\\'s heart, but Fiona swings down and knocks him into a boulder. She defeats the Merry Men with Kung Fu mixed with \"The Matrix\". Shrek and Donkey are amazed. Shrek asks Fiona where she learned that, and she replies that when one lives alone one has to learn these things. She sees that there\\'s an arrow in Shrek\\'s butt. Donkey starts panicking, so Fiona sends him off looking for a blue flower with red thorns. When Fiona tries to pull out the arrow from Shrek\\'s butt, he squirms, falls to the ground, and Fiona lands on him -- just as Donkey returns with the flower. Donkey gets mad because he thinks they just wanted to be alone. When Fiona pulls out the arrow, Donkey sees the blood and faints. Shrek picks him up, and they head back to Duloc.\\n\\nIn a field, Princess Fiona grabs a spider\\'s web and gathers up the flying bugs bothering Shrek, giving it to him, who eats it like cotton candy. Shrek catches a frog and inflates it like a balloon, handing it to Fiona. Fiona grabs a snake off a tree branch and inflates it like a balloon, and gives it to Shrek. They push each other playfully, then run off together, and their balloons float away into the air.\\n\\nThey finally reach the windmill and see Duloc in the distance. Shrek shrugs and tells Princess Fiona that her future awaits her, and she\\'s surprised to see Duloc. Donkey interrupts, and tells Fiona that Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad is compensating for something. Donkey starts to say that it means Farquaad \"has a really...\" Shrek knocks him down, a little too hard, and then tells Fiona that they should move on and starts walking. Fiona tells Shrek that she\\'s worried about Donkey, that he doesn\\'t look so good. Shrek comes over and plays along with her pretense, and says that he looks awful. Fiona tells Donkey that she\\'ll make him some tea. Donkey then acts like a hypochondriac. Shrek and Fiona go to find dinner and firewood. Fiona likes the food Shrek cooked (weed rat), saying that it\\'s delicious. She sighs, then looks at Duloc and says that she\\'ll be eating differently tomorrow night. He hopes that she will visit him in the swamp, because he\\'ll cook for her. She says that she would like that, and then they smile and look at each other. Shrek begins to ask Fiona something important, but changes his mind and asks for the rest of her food. They lean towards each other, about to kiss. Donkey butts in, saying that the sunset is romantic. Fiona jumps up, panicking. She pretends to be afraid of the dark, and Donkey tells her that he is afraid of the dark too. Fiona goes into the windmill to sleep by herself, glancing back briefly at Shrek. Donkey tells Shrek that he can tell with his animal instincts that Shrek and Fiona \"were digging on each other,\" and says that Shrek should tell Fiona how he feels about her. Shrek tries to deny that he likes her, and then dejectedly says that Fiona is a princess and he is an ogre. He walks off and tells Donkey that he\\'s getting more firewood, but Donkey sees that there\\'s still a large pile of firewood there. Shrek sits alone by a field of sunflowers, staring at Duloc until night.\\n\\nDonkey, afraid to be alone by himself in the dark, goes inside the windmill looking for Princess Fiona. A large green hand grabs the ladder, and then a female ogre looks down on Donkey as he wanders around. All the sights and sounds frighten Donkey. The ogre falls through the wood and screams as she lands on the floor, frightening Donkey even more. He\\'s terrified when she stands up, and he screams for Shrek. Donkey asks her what she did with the princess. She tries to calm and quiet him down, saying that it\\'s her, in this body. He thinks that she ate the princess and shouts at her stomach, then calls for Shrek again. She finally calms him down and convinces him that she is the princess. He wonders what happened to her, telling her that she\\'s... different. She admits that she\\'s ugly. Donkey thinks it\\'s because she ate the weed rat, but she tells him that she\\'s been this way as long as she can remember. She says that it only happens when the sun goes down. She looks at her reflection in a barrel of water and recites a spell: \"By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm until you find love\\'s first kiss and then take love\\'s true form.\" She tells Donkey that when she was a little girl a witch cast a spell on her; every night she becomes \"this, this horrible, ugly beast\"; she was placed in a tower to await the day her true love would rescue her. Fiona sits down and tells Donkey that it\\'s why she has to marry Farquaad tomorrow before the suns sets and he sees her like this. She cries, and then Donkey tries to console her. He says that she\\'s ugly, but adds that she only looks like this at night, and that Shrek is ugly all the time. She replies that she\\'s a princess, and it\\'s not how a princess should look. Donkey suggests that she shouldn\\'t marry Farquaad. She insists that she has to, because only her true love\\'s first kiss can break the spell. Donkey tells her that she\\'s an ogre, and Shrek\\'s an ogre, and that they have a lot in common.\\n\\nShrek walks back to the windmill, holding a sunflower. He\\'s rehearsing what he will say to Princess Fiona when he gives it to her. When he climbs the steps of the windmill, he overhears Fiona telling Donkey that she just can\\'t marry whomever she wants, and to take a good look at her. She asks Donkey, \"Who could ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? Princess and ugly don\\'t go together. That\\'s why I can\\'t stay here with Shrek. My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.\" She tells Donkey that it\\'s just how it should be. Shrek becomes disheartened because he thinks Fiona was calling him ugly, and then throws the sunflower down and storms off towards Duloc. Fiona tells Donkey that it\\'s the only way to break the spell. He tells her that she has to tell Shrek the truth and starts to leave, but she says that no one must ever know and makes Donkey promise not to tell anyone. Donkey says that she should tell Shrek, then goes outside. Fiona opens the door and looks around, but only sees the sunflower and takes it inside. Donkey looks around then sleeps by the campfire.\\n\\nIn the morning, Princess Fiona picks off the petals of the sunflower, reciting the \"He loves me, he loves me not\" game, but instead saying, \"I tell him, I tell him not.\" She pulls off the last petal, excited that she should tell Shrek about her spell. She opens the door and calls for him, but only sees Donkey outside snoring. The sun rises and she transforms back to human form. Shrek walks up and she rushes to greet him, but he angrily walks past her and sits on the steps. She says that she has to tell him something, but he replies that he heard everything she said last night. She says that she thought he would understand. He says he understands, quoting her asking, \"Who could ever love a hideous, ugly beast?\" She says that she thought it wouldn\\'t matter to him, but he says that it does. A horse whinnies and they turn around. Fanfare announces Lord Farquaad\\'s arrival as he rides towards them, accompanied by some knights, then Donkey wakes up. Farquaad greets Princess Fiona, and then Shrek demands that Farquaad give him the deed to his swamp, as promised. Farquaad tells Shrek that the swamp is cleared out as agreed, then tells him to take the deed and go before he changes his mind. Shrek grabs the deed and stands aside. Farquaad calls Fiona beautiful. She tells him that she was just saying a short farewell, just as a knight sets him on the ground. Farquaad says that it\\'s sweet, that she doesn\\'t have to waste good manners on the ogre; it doesn\\'t have feelings. Fiona agrees that \"it\" doesn\\'t. Farquaad grabs her hand and proposes to her. She looks at Shrek, who is staring at his deed, then accepts. Farquaad jumps up happily and tells her that he\\'ll make plans for them to marry tomorrow. She stops him and says that they should get married today, before the sun sets. Shrek angrily walks back to his swamp. Farquaad agrees that they should get married today, and talks about all the things to prepare. They both get on the horse and head to Duloc, and then Fiona tells Shrek \"fare-thee-well.\" Donkey tries to stop Shrek and says that there\\'s something he doesn\\'t know about Fiona. Shrek shouts at Donkey that he heard what they said last. He tells Donkey that since he and Fiona are great friends, Donkey should follow her home. Donkey replies that he wants to go with Shrek. Shrek continues shouting at Donkey that he lives alone in his swamp, not with anyone else, \"especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!\" Shrek storms off to his swamp.\\n\\n(\"Hallelujah\" by John Cale plays in the background.) At his swamp, Shrek sees that the fairy tale creatures are gone; only their tents remain, along with some debris. He sighs heavily and walks back to his house. Donkey walks through the forest, sadly glancing back. Shrek sees his reflection in a puddle of water, and then sadly lowers his head. Princess Fiona, in her wedding gown, looks sadly out the window. Shrek looks sadly out his window, then angrily takes a sunflower off the table and throws it into the fireplace. Fiona sadly looks at herself again in the mirror. Farquaad looks at himself in the Magic Mirror, which smiles only when he\\'s looking at it. Fiona looks at the wedding cake and pushes the figurine of Farquaad down to its proper height. She turns around and quizzically looks at the suit of armor. At the same spot, in his house, Shrek leans sadly against the table and stares at the fireplace. Donkey drinks from a pond by the forest, then is startled when he hears and sees the dragon crying; they console each other. Shrek is alone, and tries to eat at his table; Fiona is alone, and tries to eat at her table; they both put their faces in their hands.\\n\\nShrek hears a thumping sound outside and opens the door to see Donkey putting branches on the ground. Donkey tells him that it\\'s a wall. Shrek tells him that a wall should go around his swamp. Donkey replies that it does go around his half of the swamp, and that Donkey gets the other half. Donkey tells Shrek that he earned half of the swamp because he did half of the work rescuing the princess. They argue over ownership of the swamp. Shrek gives up and walks away, saying that he\\'s done with Donkey, then Donkey chases after him. Donkey says that Shrek just thinks about himself; he\\'s mean to Donkey, insults him, doesn\\'t appreciate him, and pushes him around or away. Shrek asks Donkey that if he treated him so bad, why did he come back? Donkey replies that it\\'s what friends do: they forgive each other. Shrek agrees, and then he shouts that he forgives Donkey for stabbing him in the back. Shrek goes into the outhouse and slams the door. Donkey tells Shrek that he\\'s so wrapped up like onion layers in his feelings. Shrek tells Donkey to go away, but he tells Shrek that he\\'s \"doing it again,\" like he did to Fiona; all she ever did was love him. Shrek replies that he heard their conversation, that she called him ugly, a hideous creature. Donkey tells him that she wasn\\'t talking about him, but was talking about somebody else. Shrek comes out and asks who she was talking about. Donkey refuses to tell him because Shrek doesn\\'t listen to him. Shrek apologizes, and admits that he is just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Donkey forgives him because that\\'s what friends are for. Shrek wonders what Fiona said about him, but Donkey tells him to ask her. Shrek cries out that they won\\'t make the wedding in time. Donkey whistles and the dragon flies down. Shrek climbs the chain up then the dragon puts Donkey up too. They fly away to Duloc.\\n\\nAt the castle, the bishop (voiced by Val Bettin) is marrying Princess Fiona and Lord Farquaad. Thelonius holds the rings. Two men hold up cue cards for the audience\\'s appropriate response. Fiona interrupts and asks the bishop to skip to the \"I do\\'s\". Farquaad chuckles and tells the bishop to continue. The dragon lands outside, and then the knights run away fearfully. Shrek goes to the door of the church, but Donkey tells him to wait until the preacher says, \"Speak now or forever hold your peace\", then for Shrek to say, \"I object!\" Shrek says that he doesn\\'t have time for this, but Donkey replies that chicks like romance. They go to the side of the church and Shrek repeatedly throws Donkey up to look through a window. Donkey tells Shrek that they are already married. Shrek bursts into the church just before Farquaad and Fiona kiss, shouting that he objects. Fiona and Farquaad are annoyed to see him. Shrek wants to talk to Fiona, but she says that it\\'s too late and tries to kiss Farquaad. Shrek grabs her hand and tells her that Farquaad only wants to marry her so that he can be king, then tells her that Farquaad is not her true love. Fiona asks him what he knows about true love. Shrek stammers, and Farquaad laughs because Shrek loves the princess. Farquaad cues the laughter. Fiona asks Shrek if it\\'s true, but Farquaad grabs her hand and insists that she kiss him now. Fiona looks at the setting sun and recalls her spell. She walks to the window and tells Shrek that she wanted to show this to him before. She transforms into an ogre, and then grins sheepishly at Shrek. As for Shrek, he can only casually note that her state explains a lot about her recent behaviour.\\n\\nThe audience is shocked. Farquaad sees Fiona and says that \"it\" is disgusting and orders his guards to get \"it\" out of his sight, to get them both. As Shrek and Fiona try to reach each other, Farquaad declares that the marriage is still binding, that he is still king, and puts on the crown. As guards drag Shrek away, Farquaad tells that he\\'ll beg for death. He then tells Fiona that he\\'ll lock her back in that tower for the rest of her life. Shrek frees one of his hands and whistles. The dragon bursts through the large stained glass window with Donkey on top and swallows Farquaad, killing him, then burps out his crown. Shrek tells Fiona that he loves her, and she tells him that he loves him too. They kiss, and then Fiona begins her transformation as her voice-over recounts the rest of the spell. She rises up into the air, glowing. Bright light radiates from her, then a shock wave from her shatters all the windows in the church except one (which the dragon later breaks). Fiona completes her transformation, and then returns to the floor and collapses. Shrek helps Fiona up. She\\'s still an ogre, and tells Shrek that she doesn\\'t understand, that she\\'s supposed to be beautiful. Shrek tells her that she is beautiful, and they kiss again.\\n\\nAt the swamp, Shrek and Fiona get married, with Donkey and all the fairy tale creatures as guests. The wedding song is \"I\\'m a Believer\", by Smash Mouth. One of the fairy godmothers transforms the three blind mice into horses, and a garlic bulb into a carriage, and then Shrek and Fiona leave in the carriage. Donkey takes over the song, with the others singing and dancing. The wedding celebration continues while Shrek and Fiona ride away into the sunset.\\n\\nThe fairy tale ends with \"And they lived ugly ever after. The end.\" The book closes, revealing the fairy tale to be \"Shrek\", and the song ends.\\n\\nSynopsis written by Mu_Ve_Watchr_89.', 'The Walt Disney Pictures logo and the movie title appear to the Norwegian song \"Vuelie\".\\n\\nIn a winter landscape, ice harvesters use saws and hooks to cut blocks of ice from a lake, chanting as they work about how ice is a powerful force that\\'s both beautiful and dangerous (\"Frozen Heart\"). They load the ice blocks onto their sled and ride off. A young eight year old boy named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) works alongside them (not very expertly), accompanied by his reindeer Sven (sounds: also Jonathan Groff). They try to imitate the ice harvesters with a single cubical block of ice and a small child\\'s sled, and follow them away as the Northern Lights fill the night sky.\\n\\nThe camera follows the Northern Lights through the sky, before panning down on a stave castle, located on the shores of a Scandinavian fjord, ringed in by cliffs. That night, Princess Elsa of Arendelle (Eva Bella) is fast asleep when her five year old sister Princess Anna (Livvy Stubenrauch) tries to wake her up, wanting Elsa to play with her. Elsa playfully brushes Anna off, until Anna asks, \"do you wanna build a snowman?\" to which Elsa delightfully agrees.\\n\\nFully awake, the two sisters run downstairs to the ballroom. At Anna\\'s urging, Elsa waves her hands, conjuring up a snow crystal, which she then shoots into the air. It explodes, raining snow down on them. To enhance the winter playground, she then stomps her foot, covering the entire floor with ice. They create a snowman that she nicknames Olaf, who likes warm hugs. The girls play gleefully with Olaf until Anna makes a leap Elsa wasn\\'t prepared for and the blast of power meant to create a pile of snow hits Anna in the head, knocking her out and turning several strands of her hair white. Their parents, King Agdar and Queen Idun rush in, responding to Elsa\\'s cries of anguish. They check on Anna and find her cold to the touch. Agdar and his wife hastily load both girls onto their horses and ride at full speed into the mountains.\\n\\nAs the royal family gallops through the forests at full speed, they pass by Kristoff, who is still being dragged on his sled by Sven. He becomes curious about the fact that one of the horses is leaving behind a trail of ice, in the middle of the summer.\\n\\nKristoff and Sven follow the ice trail to an empty clearing that appears to only be populated by a large assortment of moss-covered boulders. From the edge of the clearing, Kristoff watches as Agdar asks the motionless boulders to help him. Seconds later, all the boulders roll into a large circle around Agdar, Idun, Elsa, and the unconscious Anna. The rocks uncurl, revealing themselves to be trolls. The \"boulder\" Kristoff and Sven are watching the event from behind is another rock troll named Bulda, who immediately decides to adopt the visitors after Sven licks her.\\n\\nGrand Pabbie (Ciarán Hinds), the leader of the trolls, shows up and asks Agdar if Elsa was born or cursed with her abilities. He observes that Anna is lucky she was hit in the head, as a hit to the heart would have been fatal. He advises the family that it might be best if Elsa doesn\\'t use her powers around Anna. He alters Anna\\'s memories so she has no knowledge of her sister\\'s powers, remembering only the fun they\\'ve had (for instance, Anna will remember her indoor castle ice rink as a mundane winter day). Grand Pabbie warns Elsa that her powers will grow, and although they are beautiful, they will be a great risk to her if she cannot learn to control them, as fear will be her greatest enemy.\\n\\nSo Agdar and Idun take measures into their own hands based on what Grand Pabbie has told them. The palace is closed to most visitors. Staffing is reduced to a minimum. Anna and Elsa are separated, and having no memory of what has occurred, Anna is unable to comprehend why Elsa is not allowed to play with her. She often comes to Elsa\\'s closed door and tries to coax her out by asking her if she wants to build a snowman (\"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\"). As a further precaution, the sisters are also kept from leaving the castle.\\n\\nWhile Anna\\'s life is dull but normal, Elsa\\'s powers grow stronger as she matures. Her father cautions her to wear gloves to keep her icy magic in check, and to conceal her feelings, because strong emotions seem to cause her powers to manifest in unexpected ways.\\n\\nTen years after the accident, the now teenaged princesses become orphans when their parents\\' ship capsizes in a storm, drowning them. After the burial, Anna goes again to Elsa\\'s door, pleading for consolation from her only remaining family member. But Elsa, though she sits sadly on the the other side of the door, refuses to communicate with Anna.\\n\\nThree Years Later:\\n\\nElsa (now voiced by Idina Menzel) is now 21 years old, comes of age, and the castle prepares to crown her as the kingdom\\'s queen. Dignitaries from around Europe are coming to visit, including the Duke of Weselton (Alan Tudyk), who wants to run Arendelle\\'s profits dry.\\n\\nElsa is nervous about emerging from her seclusion and receiving the many guests. When Elsa gives the order to open the castle gates, Anna (now voiced by Kristen Bell) eagerly rushes out into the city (\"For the First Time In Forever\").\\n\\nAs Anna strolls out onto the streets, she crashes into a horse belonging to a charming and handsome visitor, and falls into a rowboat. The visitor apologizes and introduces himself as Prince Hans of the Southern Isles (Santino Fontana), in town for Elsa\\'s coronation. Though Anna is angered at first by Hans\\'s clumsiness (after inadvertently falling on top of her in the rowboat due to said rowboat teetering on the side of a dock and being balanced only by a leg from Hans\\'s horse), she seems smitten by him once she has a real good look at him. Anna runs off when she hears the church bells.\\n\\nElsa remains nervous during the coronation ceremony. The bishop (Robert Pine) has to remind her to remove her gloves before she takes up her golden orb and scepter. Holding them, she turns to face the congregation, but almost immediately panics when she sees the gold of the orb starting to frost while the bishop is bestowing her authority on her. She returns the orb and scepter hurriedly to the bishop and puts her gloves back on.\\n\\nAt the coronation reception a couple hours later, Kai introduces Elsa and Anna to the crowd. Anna\\'s first friendly interaction with Elsa in years brings quite the delightful feeling to Anna, flustered at first, as well as seeing Elsa so happy instead of serious and preserved boosts Anna\\'s confidence, prompting her to continue on with the conversation. They\\'re interrupted afterwards by Kai introducing to them the Duke of Weselton. The Duke is a buffoon (to the point that a running gag throughout the movie is people calling his home place \"Weasel Town\"), but an important trading partner. Elsa politely declines his offer to dance with her, but instead playfully volunteers Anna, much to the Duke\\'s delight nonetheless, and the two head off into a comical dance scene. Elsa can\\'t resist chuckling seeing Anna get innocently flustered by the Duke\\'s over-the-top (and incredibly terrible) dancing skills. This causes Anna to feel just as whimsical about the entire matter, for seeing Elsa in such a state hasn\\'t been a sight for years. Anna returns by Elsa\\'s side afterwards, commenting on how well things have been going through the day, and expresses her wishes to have things the way they were that night all the time. Elsa does agree, though her smile quickly fades away as memories of the night she froze Anna\\'s head come floating back to the surface, and she reluctantly denies Anna\\'s wishes all at once despite failing to explain why so.\\n\\nAnna then takes to the floor with Hans. The two of them quickly sneak off to spend the evening together, quickly realizing the mutual attraction between them. The romantic dance eventually leads to an entire date (\"Love is an Open Door\"), with the entire night of the young couple being spent bonding. Hans, during their time together, learns of Anna\\'s longing of having someone special in her life, with her sister apparently developing a dislike of being around her by suddenly shutting Anna out one day when they were kids. Hans openly relates to this, only furthering Anna\\'s connection with him. Hans then promises to never shut Anna out unlike Elsa, much to the princess\\' absolute joy.\\n\\nBy the end of their tour throughout the kingdom, Hans proposes right on the spot to which Anna immediately accepts. The two head back the ballroom, where Anna asks for Elsa\\'s blessing on the marriage. Elsa\\'s baffled by the shocking news, but Anna and Hans couldn\\'t appear more excited going on to ramble about the wedding arrangements. Elsa ceases the sudden rambling by denying them a marriage license, much to Anna\\'s dismay. Elsa asks to speak to Anna alone in private, likely to finally confess her abilities and why it\\'s not wise to marry someone she just met without causing a scene that would expose her powers, but Anna refuses any private conversation, stating whatever Elsa has to say can be said to both her and Hans. Elsa, becoming impatient and frustrated, outright refuses to let Anna marry someone she just met, indirectly telling Anna she knows nothing about true love. This causes Anna to hiss back, telling Elsa all she knows is how to shut people out. Although Elsa is visibly hurt by this, she continues to refuse, with the argument only worsening when she orders the guards to end the party early and close the gates.\\n\\nUnable to contain her emotions, Elsa makes a violent sweep with her left arm, causing a barrier of sharp icicles to suddenly appear around her. Shocked at the room\\'s reaction to her powers, Elsa rushes from the room.\\n\\nPanicking, Elsa flees with Anna in hot pursuit. As she bolts out the door, she finds a huge crowd waiting for her in the courtyard. She hastily rushes through as men applaud her. A concerned woman asks Elsa if she\\'s all right. She is frightened enough that she backs into an ornamental fountain and freezes it solid when she grabs it with her left hand. The Duke of Weselton comes out the same door moments later. Elsa pleads for people to step back, moments before another bolt of ice shoots from her hands, nearly hitting the Duke and his guards. She keeps running away, sprinting across the waters of the fjord, her feet forming an ice bridge, and vanishes into the forest on the other side of the fjord.\\n\\nAnna calls after her sister, but as she, Hans, and the other guests watch, the waters of the fjord completely ice over and the air takes on an icy chill. Moments later, snow begins to fall.\\n\\nThe Duke of Weselton begins to panic, declaring they must take action and put an end to Elsa\\'s curse. Anna, however, refuses and volunteers to seek out Elsa herself and make things right, feeling that it\\'s her fault for pushing her. With Hans being left in charge of the kingdom, Anna sets out on horse to begin her search for Elsa.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Elsa has found her way to a high precipice on the North Mountain, many miles from civilization. It is here she realizes that far away from what she was taught, being on her own, she can begin to control her powers (\"Let it Go\"). She constructs an elaborate ice palace, changes her confining wardrobe into a shimmering dress, and vows to stay in seclusion, where she feels she can be herself, and harm no one else.\\n\\nThe next morning, Anna is seen travelling slowly through knee-deep snow on horseback. Her journey is hindered when her horse is spooked by falling snow and runs off. She is forced to spend the rest of the day trudging through knee deep snow, all the while griping that she wishes Elsa had the ability to cover the fjords in a tropical paradise. She sighs with relief upon seeing a building with smoke coming from a chimney. Just then, Anna slips and falls into an ice-cold creek, which freezes her dress stiff. She staggers the rest of the way to the cabin with the chimney, a place known as Wandering Oaken\\'s Trading Post and Sauna, run by its burly owner, Oaken (Chris Williams).\\n\\nAnna quickly staggers into Oaken\\'s store. He doesn\\'t have much winter gear in stock (it\\'s supposed to be the off season), aside from one pair of boots and a single women\\'s mink coat. Anna inquires if Elsa has visited recently, but Oaken tells her that she\\'s the only person crazy enough to be out in a storm like this. As if on cue, Kristoff staggers in out of the storm, seeking to buy some rope, an ax, and carrots for Sven. Oaken can\\'t help but notice that Kristoff is bundled up tightly. Kristoff replies that there\\'s a real howler going on up on the North Mountain. As Anna waits for Oaken to return his attention to her, Kristoff argues with Oaken over the outrageous price gouging on the items he needs (due to Oaken claiming that there\\'s a supply and demand problem since Kristoff is buying from the almost-bare shelves of the winter department), which ends with Oaken roughly throwing Kristoff out into the snow after Kristoff makes the mistake of calling him a crook.\\n\\nKristoff and Sven take refuge in a barn on Oaken\\'s property, but are soon met by Anna, who has bought Kristoff\\'s supplies for him, on condition he take her up the North Mountain immediately. Kristoff eventually agrees.\\n\\nAnna and Kristoff set off into the night with Sven driving. As the discussion turns to Elsa, Anna explains about her whirlwind engagement to Hans. Kristoff is incredulous at Anna\\'s foolhardiness in getting engaged to someone she just met that day, to the point that he quizzes her about Hans to see how little she really knows about him. Their conversation is interrupted when the sled is ambushed by a pack of wolves. Kristoff is initially reluctant to let Anna assist him, but Anna proves to be useful and manages to take out a few of the wolves by herself. There is a moment of panic when the two see a gaping ravine up ahead. Kristoff hurriedly throws Anna onto Sven\\'s back, then, just as they reach the cliff, he uses his knife to cut Sven\\'s harness. Anna and Sven successfully clear the chasm, and Kristoff does, just barely, but his sled falls to the bottom of the ravine and explodes. Kristoff is at first upset that his sled is gone (as he\\'d just paid it off), but after \"arguing\" with Sven (which consists of Kristoff speaking his own opinion in his own voice and then delivering Sven\\'s \"counterargument\" in a goofy voice), decides to help Anna keep going, worried for her safety. Anna promises she will replace the sled.\\n\\nEarly the next morning, Anna and Kristoff enter a frosted-over glen. They suddenly hear a new voice and meet a talking snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad). The introductions don\\'t go smoothly, as Anna screams and kicks Olaf\\'s head off upon first seeing him. Anna doesn\\'t recognize Olaf until he gives his name and adds, \"and I like warm hugs.\" This jogs Anna\\'s memories and she remembers building him with Elsa when they were young. Anna and Kristoff mention that they\\'re looking for Elsa so they can restore summertime, and Olaf suddenly grows excited; it\\'s his dream to see what summer is like, and he fantasizes about what he wants to do in the summertime in a Busby-Berkeley dance number (\"In Summer\"). Anna and Kristoff choose not to reveal that he will melt in the summer heat, but follow him as he leads them to Elsa\\'s ice palace.\\n\\nIn the late afternoon, Anna, Kristoff and Olaf arrive at Elsa\\'s ice palace. Sven waits at the bottom of the stairway leading up to the front doors, as his feet can\\'t get a grip on the icy steps. Meanwhile, when they get to the front door, Anna tells Kristoff and Olaf to wait outside, warning them that the last time she introduced Elsa to a guy, she froze everything (making Elsa look like an overprotective sister). The dejected Olaf and Kristoff wait outside and start counting to 60 while Anna heads inside.\\n\\nInside, Anna is stunned at the glorious interior of the palace and, even more amazed, to see the new ice dress Elsa has conjured for herself. Though Elsa is happy to see Anna and quickly forgives her for the argument that happened at the coronation party, she becomes nervous and suggests Anna leave so she can\\'t do any harm to her. The conversation is momentarily interrupted when Olaf crashes the meeting (having taken Anna\\'s request of \"give us a minute\" quite literally). Elsa is astonished to find that her powers include the ability to conjure up living snowmen.\\n\\nAs it turns out, Elsa is surprised to learn that her entire kingdom is frozen, and Anna is surprised in turn to learn that Elsa doesn\\'t know how to stop it. But Anna insists her sister\\'s powers are no reason why they should be so distant. However, having seen Olaf, Elsa flashes back to accidentally hitting Anna in the head with her snow abilities and grows scared, demanding Anna leave.\\n\\nElsa retreats to the upper portion of the palace, and Anna follows her, pleading with her sister that they can solve this problem together (\"For the First Time In Forever (Reprise)\"). But Elsa grows so upset that she unleashes an icy chill, of which a portion accidentally strikes Anna again but this time in her heart.\\n\\nElsa retreats to the upper portion of the palace, and Anna follows her, pleading with her sister that they can solve this problem together (\"For the First Time In Forever (Reprise)\"). But Anna\\'s promising to stand by her sister\\'s side and help her, Elsa only grows more agitated and nervous resulting in her magic flaring. Elsa, in desperation to get her sister to safety, creates a giant snow creature (that Olaf calls \"Marshmallow\") to throw them out.\\n\\nMarshmallow deposits Anna, Kristoff and Olaf on the front steps outside the ice palace. Though he initially leaves them alone, Anna is pissed off and quickly throws a snowball at him. Marshmallow is provoked, and chases Anna and Kristoff into the woods.\\n\\nMarshmallow manages to corner them at the edge of a cliff, though Kristoff immediately begins digging a snow anchor by using a rope to safely guide himself and Anna down the mountain to safety. Marshmallow, however, catches up to them, though Olaf tries to stop him (to comically little success). Marshmallow, annoyed, kicks Olaf over the cliff, and continues his chase for Anna and Kristoff. He pulls them up to his face by the rope, and screams in their face \"DON\"T COME BACK!\". Anna then grabs Kristoff\\'s knife and cuts the rope. This sends the duo into free fall, onto a twenty foot deep pile of fresh snow. With his mission to drive them away complete, Marshmallow returns to the ice palace.\\n\\nAs they recover from the landing, Kristoff notices that Anna\\'s hair has started to turn white. Fearful that she may be injured, Kristoff takes her to his family...who happen to be a group of rock trolls -- the same ones that saved Anna many years before. Kristoff explains that as he had no family at a young age, the trolls took him and Sven in.\\n\\nThe trolls are overjoyed to meet Anna, and at first they eagerly believe that she is Kristoff\\'s steady girlfriend, so they try to marry them in a dance number (\"Fixer-Upper\"), and almost get all the way through the vows before being stopped by the accidental participants and Anna faints. However, he tells them that she is injured and needs their assistance. Just as he did 13 years ago, Grand Pabbie comes forward and examines Anna, but concludes that this time her sister\\'s powers struck her in the heart. Pabbie cannot save her; Anna\\'s heart has begun to freeze. Grand Pabbie says \"an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.\" Anna collapses again and her hair turns more white. She weakly tells Kristoff that Hans can surely help, and they take off for Arendelle.\\n\\nMeanwhile in the city, Hans has been providing shelter and help for Arendelle\\'s people. When Anna\\'s horse returns, riderless, Hans asks for volunteers to join him in bringing Anna back. The Duke of Weselton volunteers his two bodyguards, and secretly tells them to shoot Elsa if they should encounter her.\\n\\nThe next morning, Hans\\'s party arrives at Elsa\\'s ice castle. Shortly after they arrive, Hans orders that no harm is to come to Elsa. While everyone agrees, the Duke\\'s thugs quietly disagree, still following the Duke\\'s orders to kill her. The moment they come close enough, Marshmallow reveals himself from the form of snow boulders piled up by the base of the stairs, and jumps right into battle. The archer immediately attack the beast with their arrows, infuriating Marshmallow and causing his ultimate form to be unleashed. Marshmallow is able to hold most of the guards off. Hans, however, proves to be a fierce warrior himself, avoiding each of Marshmallow\\'s attacks and eventually using his sword to slice the snow monster\\'s leg off and cause him to lose balance and begin tumbling over to a large gorge. With Marshmallow wounded, Hans begins heading inside Elsa\\'s castle. Marshmallow, however, doesn\\'t give up, giving one last swing in attempt to drag Hans down with him. Marshmallow fails, and plummets down into the chasm below, apparently to his death.\\n\\nWhile Hans has been battling Marshmallow, the Duke\\'s two men have managed to use the distraction to barge up the ice steps and into the castle, where they corner Elsa. Despite her pleading for them to not shoot, they shoot at her. She quickly forms walls of ice as shields to block their shots. Eventually, she has the beardless thug pinned to a wall by several icicles and is on the verge of using a wall of ice to shove the bearded thug off the balcony. Hans and his men show up just in time and Hans pleads for her to stop, so she doesn\\'t become the monster people accuse her of being. Elsa settles down a bit at Hans\\' words, realizing what she\\'s doing. The guy pinned to the wall, still complying with the orders of the Duke, aims his crossbow at Elsa\\'s head and prepares to shoot her. Hans suddenly runs over and deflects the bow. The arrow is released and hits the bolt attaching an icy chandelier to the ceiling, which begins to fall straight for Elsa\\'s head. Elsa tries to run, but the falling chandelier fragments and knocks her unconscious.\\n\\nWhen Elsa wakes up, she\\'s back at the castle in a dungeon cell, her hands chained and encased in steel mitts. As she looks out over the frozen kingdom, Hans appears, telling Elsa that Anna has not returned, and pleads with her to stop the winter. Elsa claims she can\\'t, and must be let go to keep others from being harmed.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Kristoff and Sven arrive at the castle. Anna\\'s condition has grown worse Kristoff tries to keep her warm by giving her his hat. Several of the castle staff escort her in; she looks back as Kristoff and Sven leave. Anna is brought to Hans and tells him that he has to kiss her in order to save her.\\n\\nThe castle staff in the room quickly leave to give them privacy. She explains what happened and she collapses. Hans places Anna in a chair, leans in as if to kiss her... and says \"Oh, Anna, if only there was someone here who loved you!\" As Anna looks at him in shock, Hans explains that as the youngest of 13 brothers, he had no chance at claiming his family\\'s throne, so he went looking for a royal family he could marry into. Unable to get to Elsa, he made Anna\\'s acquaintance and played on her naivete. He intended to marry her before causing some form of \"accident\" for Elsa that would clear his path to the throne.\\n\\nHowever, given Anna\\'s current condition, he plans to simply let her frozen heart overcome her, then stab Elsa, ending the eternal winter. Anna tries to stop Hans, but he extinguishes the fire in the nearby fireplace before locking her in the room. It is then that Anna collapses, her hair now completely turns white.\\n\\nHans goes to speak with the duke of Weselton and several other dignitaries. He claims that Elsa has caused Anna to freeze to death, but before she died he and Anna recited their wedding vows. This apparently is enough to give him full authority to declare Elsa guilty of treason and sentence her to death.\\n\\nThe palace guards go to Elsa\\'s cell, but are detained when a wall of the cell collapses. While they are held up, Elsa freezes her shackles to the point that they shatter, and then breaks through the wall to the outside.\\n\\nMeanwhile, far from Arendelle, Kristoff and Sven are trekking away when Sven urges Kristoff to go back. Kristoff claims he has no need to, but as they look back at Arendelle, a mysterious swirling cloud of snow begins to engulf the kingdom. The two then take off towards the growing danger.\\n\\nOlaf has managed to find Anna in the locked room, and seeing her freezing, quickly lights a fire in the fireplace. Anna explains that Hans wasn\\'t her true love, and that Olaf should leave or he\\'ll melt. However, the little snowman says he will not leave her side until he finds an act of true love that can save her. As they talk, Olaf recalls how Kristoff did so much to get her back to save her, when the wind blows a window open. Olaf goes to close it, but in the distance he sees Kristoff and Sven charging towards them.\\n\\nThis gives Anna hope. She realizes that they\\'re in love: maybe Kristoff can save her. Olaf helps her up, but in the hallway, ice springs up to block their path. Going out a window, the two slide down the castle\\'s steep roofs. Anna attempts to make her way across the icy fjord, with Olaf close behind. However, as the wind picks up, Olaf is blown away, and Anna finds her hands are turning to ice and her face is icy. Even so, she continues to move forward, calling out Kristoff\\'s name.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Hans has found Elsa wandering the ice of the fjord. Thinking he\\'s come for her, Elsa tells him to leave her alone, and take care of Anna. Hans lies and says that Anna was killed by Elsa\\'s magic. The pain of this causes Elsa to collapse, the snow in tears and in the air the snowflakes are suddenly hanging in stillness.\\n\\nThe clearing of the whiteout enables Kristoff to see Anna, and he runs to her, but as Anna looks around, she sees Hans about to stab Elsa. Even with her own life at stake, Anna rushes in front of Hans, blocking the knife. As she does so, her frozen heart finally consumes her, turning her into a statue of ice, and shattering Hans\\' blade.\\n\\nKristoff and Sven arrive seconds later. Seeing Anna turned to ice, Elsa breaks down in tears, hugging her sister. No one is sure what to say, when Anna\\'s icy form begins to change and gain color, and she returns to normal! Anna broke her own spell: saving Elsa was an act of true love. And her hair turns back to normal and her streak is gone.\\n\\nIt is then that Elsa realizes what can end the winter: love. And with this realization, she dissipates the ice and snow, and summer returns to the kingdom. Olaf is found, and before he can melt, Elsa creates a perpetual snow flurry above his head, which lets him survive the summer heat.\\n\\nIn the aftermath, Hans is taken back to his kingdom by a French ambassador, who promise to see he is punished for his attempted regicide. The duke is as hotheaded as ever and tries to play the innocent victim. But remembering that he sent two men to kill her, Elsa issues a decree to sever all trade with Weselton. To piss the duke off even further, she tells the messenger to call his duchy \"Weasel Town.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Anna makes good on her promise and replaces Kristoff\\'s sled. She also tells him that Elsa has appointed him the castle\\'s official ice deliverer. Kristoff is so grateful that he kisses her. If he wonders why a queen who can conjure ice out of thin air needs ice deliveries, he keeps the question to himself.\\n\\nHaving come to grips with her powers and learning they can be a blessing and not a curse, Elsa uses them to create a wintry spectacle in the summer sky. She also turns the castle\\'s courtyard into an ice rink, where she informs Anna that the gates to the castle will never be closed again. With the city\\'s people in attendance, the sisters skate around the rink, happy that they are finally together again.\\n\\nAfter the credits are over, we cut back to Elsa\\'s ice palace, where it\\'s revealed that Marshmallow survived the fall after Hans cut off his leg. Wandering through the empty ice palace, he finds the tiara that Elsa tossed away during \"Let It Go\", and puts it on his head, smiling to himself, and the spikes and fangs on his back quickly retract.', 'Set in an animated world controlled by animals, the film starts with a young koala bear named Buster Moon (voice of Matthew McConaughey) going to see his very first musical production as a child. He is utterly enthralled by the show and quickly forms the dream to work in theater. As an adult, Buster has taken over the same theater where he saw that play. However, business hasn\\'t been going so well, and the theater is in trouble. Buster\\'s assistant Ms. Crawley (voice of Garth Jennings) informs him that angry stage crew workers are outside because their checks have bounced. Buster gets away on his bike as he rushes to the bank.\\n\\nAs Buster rides through town, we meet some of the other main characters - Johnny the gorilla (voice of Taron Egerton) is singing to himself in an alley, but he ducks when he sees some cops. He speaks into a radio to tell a group of guys to stay put, but his father, gang leader Big Daddy (voice of Peter Serafinowicz), and his goons break out and grab Johnny as they have just robbed some valuables. Next we meet Rosita the pig (voice of Reese Witherspoon), an overworked mother of 25 piglets and wife to Norman (voice of Nick Offerman), who doesn\\'t notice just how much work she does, or that she likes to sing. Then we see porcupines Ash (voice of Scarlett Johansson) and her boyfriend Lance (voice of Beck Bennett), a punk rock duo with Lance singing lead. He doesn\\'t like it when Ash steps in to sing on her own. Somewhere else across town we meet Meena the elephant (voice of Tori Kelly), singing to her grandfather (voice of Jay Pharaoh) for his birthday. He loves her voice and encourages her to get out and show others what she\\'s got. Finally we meet Mike the mouse (voice of Seth MacFarlane), a sax player who is also greedy and selfish. He calls out a guy who gives him only a coin and forces him to give up whatever else he\\'s got in his pockets.\\n\\nBuster shows up at a restaurant to meet with his sheep friend Eddie (voice of John C. Reilly), whose family has invested a lot in Buster\\'s theater, and they have not been happy with the results. Buster thinks he\\'s come up with the answer to all his problems - he wants to hold a singing competition at his theater. Eddie isn\\'t keen on the idea, and soon, he and Buster get kicked out of the restaurant when Buster takes out some sandwiches.\\n\\nBuster has Ms. Crawley make flyers for the competition. Since he doesn\\'t have a lot of money to offer as a reward, he tells her to advertise a $1,000 reward, with a bunch of junk stuffed into a treasure chest to make it look like it holds prize money. Ms. Crawley\\'s glass eye pops out and bounces on the keyboard, causing the ad to say the reward is $100,000. She prints out hundreds of flyers, but she stands next to the fan, causing it to blow every single flyer into town. Many animals find the flyers and think they have a shot at something big.\\n\\nThe next day, Buster is surprised to see a whole line of animals going down the block outside the theater. Over a hundred animals, including Johnny, Rosita, Mike, and Ash all audition. Meena goes to audition, but she has a severe case of stage fright and she bails. When all is said and done, Buster selects Johnny, Mike, and Ash (without Lance) as the solo acts, while Rosita is paired up with another pig named Gunter (voice of Nick Kroll). Buster then learns that Ms. Crawley advertised a $100,000 reward, and he panics while trying to maintain the illusion that there is a lot of money in that chest.\\n\\nThe animals start rehearsing for the show. Buster gives them a list of songs they can go with. Johnny learns he has to play the piano, and Ash is none too pleased to be given a list of cheesy pop songs since she is a teenage girl. Meena returns after having been pressured by her grandfather to re-audition. She brings Buster a cake and finds him as he is trying to connect an extension cord to a nearby building after the electric company shuts off the power. Since Meena is too nervous to ask for a second chance, Buster assumes she wants to be part of the stage crew. She accepts, and Meena returns home to find that her mother (voice of Leslie Jones) told all their friends that Meena got in the show.\\n\\nA bank rep named Judith goes by the theater to tell Buster to get his accounts sorted or else the bank will take the theater. Buster approaches Eddie and asks if he can get his grandmother, legendary performer Nana Noodleman (voice of Jennifer Saunders), to give the theater some funding. Eddie is nervous about talking to Nana, but Buster tags along to convince her to invest in the theater. Nana thinks Buster ruined the theater with the shows he\\'s put on, but he never gives up with trying to change her mind.\\n\\nOutside of rehearsals, the other animals deal with issues of their own. Ash wants to write an original song, but Lance isn\\'t supportive of her making her own music. Ash later finds Lance working with another girl porcupine named Becky, prompting Ash to kick Lance out of her apartment.\\n\\nMike becomes so confident that he will win the reward that he takes out a loan so he can buy a fancy car to impress a lady mouse. They enter a nightclub where Mike plays against three big bears. One of the bears sees that Mike cheated, and he chases after the mouse, only to lose him as he escapes the club.\\n\\nDuring rehearsal, Johnny is supposed to be a getaway driver for Big Daddy and his gang as they are trying to steal some gold. Johnny tries to take his spare time to go to rehearsal, but when he needs to get back, he gets stuck in a traffic jam as a result of a car accident that he caused when rushing back to the theater. Big Daddy and his boys are arrested. Johnny later visits his dad in jail and admits that he was rehearsing for the show and that he would rather be a singer than to be in his dad\\'s gang. Big Daddy is furious and he disowns Johnny.\\n\\nAt night, Johnny sneaks into the theater and tries to steal the treasure chest, thinking he can use the supposed money in there to bail out his dad. However, he stops when he sees his own audition sheet and sees that Buster wrote him down as a natural-born singer. Ms. Crawley appears, and Johnny plays it off as though he just needed more piano lessons. She happily sits down to help him.\\n\\nBuster gets Meena to help him organize a set-up for a preview that he will put on for Nana. They get water from a water tower and use krill to come up with a lights display. Nana arrives and is impressed by the show so far, but the three bears find Mike in the theater and threaten to eat him unless he gives them their money. Mike tells the bears that the money is in the treasure chest. The main bear smashes the chest, revealing all of Buster\\'s junk and no money. His ruse is exposed to the other animals, but things get worse when the water tank cracks, causing the whole theater to get flooded and eventually completely destroyed.\\n\\nThe bank now owns what\\'s left of the theater. Buster sinks into despair and hopelessness. The animal cast heads over to Eddie\\'s home where Buster is staying to try and cheer him up, but he has given up and declares himself a failure.\\n\\nBuster and Ms. Crawley start a car wash business like his father used to do. Eddie steps in to help him out. A while later, Buster overhears Meena singing \"Hallelujah\" by herself where the theater used to be. Impressed and reinvigorated by her singing, Buster comes up with a new plan.\\n\\nBuster calls the animals so that the show may go on. Mike bails when he learns that it\\'s no longer a competition and there won\\'t be any prize money. They set up a stage in the middle of the theater ruins and get some of the animals\\' families to come by, except it\\'s just Rosita and Meena\\'s families that show up. The show begins with Rosita and Gunter performing \"Shake It Off\" with a dance in sparkly outfits. Rosita\\'s kids are all excited, and Norman is so astonished that he runs up on the stage to kiss his wife.\\n\\nNext, with more people arriving, Johnny plays the piano and sings \"I\\'m Still Standing\". Big Daddy watches from prison and is amazed by his son\\'s singing. He immediately breaks out to go see Johnny, leading to a citywide manhunt for Big Daddy.\\n\\nAsh gets on to play her original song, but Judith comes by to unplug the music and tell everyone to leave. Ash continues to play the song, \"Set It All Free\", which even Lance is watching from home. Ash gets so into it that she accidentally shoots out quills into the audience. Regardless, the audience, after reemerging from cover, goes wild for this new rock star and even Judith is moved to allow the show to proceed for now.\\n\\nMike sees the show on TV and sets out to prove to viewers that he\\'s better than the rest. He rushes to the theater and puts on a soulful rendition of \"My Way\", right as the police helicopters fly overhead, nearly pulling Mike into the sky. He manages to finish the song with a spectacular flourish as he swings on the microphone cord, but the bears see the show and head to the theater to get him. Meanwhile, Big Daddy has made it to the theater and sees Johnny. He hugs his son and apologizes for what he said to him, then praises his musical talent. Big Daddy then willingly goes back to prison.\\n\\nMeena is the last performer. She is very nervous until Buster convinces her to get out there. She starts a slow and shy version of \"Don\\'t You Worry About a Thing\" before belting out her voice, which even leaves Mike with his jaw on the floor. Eventually, Meena concludes the song by literally bringing down the house when her energetic finish causes a partial collapse of the surrounding remaining structure. The bears show up and snatch Mike, nearly eating him until the lady mouse shows up to save Mike.\\n\\nNana, having been in the audience the whole time, sees Buster and applauds with the rest of the audience. She finally gives Buster her funding so that they can re-purchase the theater and rebuild it into an even bigger and better theater.\\n\\nThe film ends with Buster and all his new friends gathered for the theater\\'s grand reopening.', 'No Synopsis', 'No Synopsis', \"Over a quaint area of land, shrouded by fog, a lone herder guides his sheep to pasture as a gigantic, metallic structure moves on four spindly legs into the highlands where the cloud cover quickly consumes it.\\n\\nIn a nearby city, young Sophie (English: Emily Mortimer Japanese: Chieko Baisho) sits at her window sewing adornments on a hat. Her boss enters and tells her the store is closing before inviting her out. Sophie politely declines. Some of her coworkers chatter excitedly and point outside. Sophie looks and sees the metallic object vanishing in the far off hills. The so-called 'castle', as the girls call it, belongs to a reclusive wizard named Howl (English: Christian Bale Japanese: Takuya Kimura) who is reputed to steal the hearts of beautiful young women. The girls joke about whether they will be preyed upon as they leave. Sophie finishes her hat and exits the store alone.\\n\\nShe takes a trolley downtown and decides to cut through an alleyway since a parade of soldiers is moving down the main street. As she appears to look for a particular address, she bumps into a couple of soldiers who begin to flirt with her. Sophie explains that her sister is waiting for her, but the soldiers refuse to let her leave. She then backs up into a handsome young man who drapes his arm around her, claiming to have been looking for her. With a quick gesture, he forces the soldiers into a straight stance and sends them marching down the alley. He then offers to escort Sophie wherever she needs to go and tells her not to be alarmed, but he's being followed. As they walk down the alley, a number of globular shadows appear out of the walls and begin to rush towards them. The mysterious man apologizes for getting Sophie involved and, as the shadows are about to merge on them, puts his arm around her waist before leaping high into the air. As they hover above the rooftops, he instructs her to start walking. They step through the air together and the man sets Sophie down on the balcony of her sister's bakery. He tells her he will draw off their pursuers and that she should wait a bit before going outside again, and then leaves.\\n\\nDownstairs, Sophie's sister, Lettie (Jena Malone), is told of her arrival. She rushes upstairs to tell Sophie that she was seen floating onto the balcony with a strange man. Sophie recalls the experience as if it was a dream and later explains to Lettie that the man must have been a wizard. Lettie advises her on the dangers of trusting wizards and that, if it had been Howl, he would have surely stolen her heart. Melancholy, Sophie notes that Howl only preys upon 'pretty' girls. Lettie resigns to this statement and warns Sophie to be careful, regardless, and that even the Witch of the Wastes (English: Lauren Bacall Japanese: Akihiro Miwa) is on the move.\\n\\nLettie asks if Sophie will spend the rest of her life in the hat shop, but Sophie reminds her that the store was important to their father. Lettie tells Sophie that she should live her own life before Sophie leaves.\\n\\nSophie arrives back at the hat shop and locks the door behind her but, as she's putting her hat away, a large and elegant woman enters through the door. Sophie tells her the shop is closed but the woman ignores her and insults the shop, calling it tacky. Growing angry, Sophie once again asks the woman to leave but is reprimanded for standing up to the Witch of the Wastes. Before she can react, the Witch flies towards Sophie and flows over her like a windswept fabric, covering her in dark magic. The Witch glides back to the door and asks Sophie to give her regards to Howl before closing the door behind her. She leaves quickly in a sedan chair carried by two Shadow Men; the same globular figures that pursued Sophie earlier.\\n\\nWhen Sophie finally looks up, she is horrified to discover that shes been aged into an elderly woman. She struggles to stay calm despite her haggard appearance. The next morning, her mother (English: Mari Devon) arrives at the shop to hear that Sophie is locked in her room, apparently ill. When she leaves, Sophie gets up and tries to motivate herself; accepting that now, at least, her clothes are appropriate for her age and decides that can't stay at the shop. She packs a few things and leaves town, catching conversation on the streets that the prince of another country has gone missing and that war is imminent.\\n\\nSophie hitches a ride out of town and heads for the mountains, despite the driver's warning that there's nothing out there but witches and wizards. After a while she takes a rest to eat the food she's packed and notices a stick protruding out of a nearby bush. Deciding it will make a nice walking cane, she yanks it out with some force and realizes that its a scarecrow which is somehow standing on its own. She names it Turnip-head before strolling away. Turnip-head follows Sophie, hopping along on its pole, despite her objections to having dealt with enough magic for the day. As the sky grows darker and the wind picks up, Sophie struggles up the hillside. Turnip-head fetches a walking stick for her which she gratefully accepts before asking if there is a place where she can find shelter. Turnip-head bounces away and Sophie muses to herself how clever she's gotten to have convinced him to leave.\\n\\nHowever, Turnip-head soon returns, to Sophie's shock, with Howl's Castle close behind. Though it is the last thing Sophie was thinking of when she asked for shelter, she discovers a back door hanging from the rear of the castle as it walks over her. She runs for the door and is allowed entry.\\n\\nNothing stirs within and there is no light save for a single fire set on a large hearth. Sophie sits herself down on a chair in front of the fire, commenting how the place is less like a castle and more like a living room overstuffed with junk. Still, in her old age she realizes nothing scares her anymore and begins to doze off. Suddenly, the fire in front of her conjures eyes and notes that Sophie has quite a curse on her. It introduces itself as a powerful fire demon named Calcifer (English: Billy Crystal Japanese: Tatsuya Gashûin) and offers to relieve Sophie's curse if she helps him with his. Sophie asks if he can be trusted and denies his proposal but he pleads with her and claims that his master, Howl, keeps him under a tight regimen. Falling asleep, Sophie relents and agrees to help him though, as he watches her, Calcifer doubts her ability.\\n\\nIn a bayside town, two officials approach a building and knock on the door. The sound awakens Sophie who looks to the door with some confusion before a young boy comes down the stairs. Sophie feigns sleep again as the boy approaches and Calcifer mentions the knock came from the Porthaven door. The boy, Markl (English: Josh Hutcherson Japanese: Ryunosuke Kamiki), dons a magical disguise that makes him appear like an old man and answers the door after turning a color-coded knob. Sophie looks over curiously and is amazed to see that the door has opened to a new area. The officials at the door ask for the Wizard Jenkins and inform Markl that he's been summoned to lend his magical assistance to the war effort. Markl accepts the notice and shuts the door before addressing Sophie who's giving Calcifer fresh wood. She tells Markl that Calcifer allowed her inside but Calcifer objects, saying she simply wandered in from the wastes.\\n\\nMarkl wonders aloud if Sophie is a witch but a knock at the door draws his attention away. He opens it to help a young customer who asks if Sophie is a witch. Sophie responds that she's the scariest witch of them all before the customer is sent off with her potion. Markl tells Sophie not to lie to customers and, when she points out his own disguise, informs her that he needs to practice his magic. When another knock sounds on the door, Markl opens the door to reveal the capital city of Kingsbury where another pair of officials requests the assistance of the Wizard Pendragon. Amazed, Sophie tries the knob out for herself, finding that each color represents a different location. When she asks about a fourth, black setting on the wheel, Markl says that only Howl knows where it leads.\\n\\nMarkl begins to make breakfast for himself and Sophie notices a basket of eggs and bacon. She offers to make something for him but he explains that Calcifer only obeys Howl. However, Sophie manages to force Calcifer into obedience by threatening to dump water on him or, worse, tell Howl of their secret agreement. Calcifer reluctantly agrees to obey and cook the food while Markl, amazed at Sophie's willpower, fetches a kettle to boil tea. The knob beside the door turns to the black setting and the handsome stranger Sophie met the day before walks in. Sophie is startled when Markl addresses him as Master Howl and tries to calmly continue cooking before introducing herself as his new cleaning lady, hired by Calcifer. Howl gently pushes her aside and takes over the cooking, feeding the eggshells to Calcifer. The three then sit down to eat and Howl asks Sophie what she has in her pocket. She reaches in and is surprised to find a red note hidden there. She hands it to Howl and, as it touches his fingers, the note bursts into flame and burns an inscription on the table from the Witch of the Wastes. The encrypted message reads that Howl's heart will soon belong to her. Howl rubs the message off the table, looking pained as he does so, before feeding Calcifer his breakfast and instructing him to heat hot water for his bath and move the castle further to the west. He then heads for the door, calling back to Sophie not to get too carried away cleaning, and leaves through the black portal.\\n\\nMarkl questions if Sophie is working for the Witch of the Wastes, but Sophie angrily denies it, her mouth abruptly sealing shut before she can utter a word about her curse, and promises to throttle the witch the next time she sees her. She orders Markl to finish his breakfast and furiously begins cleaning. Markl does his best to move extra things outside and warns customers to return later as there is a 'witch on the rampage inside'. Having cleaned most of the room, Sophie goes to remove the ashes from the hearth while Calcifer warns her that he may go out. She ignores his whining and moves the last bit of wood to hang over a pot with Calcifer clinging to it, his round lower half dangling. As she takes the ashes outside, Calcifer falls and smolders in the pot. When Sophie comes back inside she sees Howl standing over the hearth, encouraging Calcifer to reignite on new logs of wood. He calmly advises her not to torment his friend before leaving once again. Sophie goes upstairs to clean and tells Markl to put away whatever he doesn't want thrown out. After noticing the particularly dirty bathroom, Sophie sees the castle moving outside. She walks out onto a balcony, standing a bit straighter, and admires the high view of the countryside. She calls down to Calcifer, complimenting him on his spark which pleases him greatly. Markl joins Sophie outside and notices a long pole sticking out of one of the castles recesses. Recognizing it, Sophie pulls Turnip-head out of the hole. He regains his stance and bounces on the roof of the castle. Markl asks Sophie if she is, indeed, a witch to which she responds that she's the worst kind; the kind that cleans.\\n\\nLater, Calcifer sets the castle down by a mountain lake and Markl and Turnip-head help Sophie string out the laundry. Markl suggests that Turnip-head is a demon but Sophie says that, if that's true, he must be a good demon since he led her here. She sits by the side of the lake and sighs to Markl that she's never felt more at peace.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Howl flies in a bird-like form over a fiery landscape, watching as large airships drop bombs. A number of menacing winged creatures fly towards him but he swiftly eludes them and escapes through a break in the clouds, sealing it shut behind him.\\n\\nBack at the castle, the door opens and Howl walks through, his wings drooping and his feathers scorched. He sits in the chair in front of Calcifer's hearth and, with difficulty, transforms back into his human self. Calcifer warns him that, if he continues to transform, it will be harder to become human again but cheerfully shows Howl the extra firewood Sophie left for him. Howl admits that the war is getting worse and other wizards have been recruited to fight, most having gotten to the point where they can't remember being human. He asks Calcifer to heat water for his bath and stops by a curtain drawn to the side of the room. He pulls it back to see Sophie sleeping in her youthful form and considers her a moment before going upstairs. The sound of the water running awakens Sophie, once again elderly.\\n\\nThat day, Sophie and Markl walk to the Porthaven market to buy food. Near the harbor, a crowd of people suddenly comes together as a battle-ravaged ship arrives at port. Sophie urges Markl to leave as she notices a shadow man scouring the crowd. An enemy airship flies overhead, dropping bombs into the harbor and sending leaflets of propaganda falling to the ground. Sophie and Markl rush back to Wizard Jenkins' shop and shut the door. Suddenly, Howl comes running down the stairs with a towel wrapped around his waist, howling and clutching his hair, turned from blonde to a vivid red. He yells at Sophie for getting carried away and ruining his bath potions. She defends herself, saying she merely moved things about but Howl is inconsolable. He sits down and moans that he looks hideous, turning his hair black and saying that there's no point to living if he can't be beautiful. The room begins to shake and shadows stretch. Markl says that Howl is summoning spirits of darkness and did this once when a girl dumped him.\\n\\nWhen Sophie tries to comfort him, Howl's body begins to excrete ooze. Nervous and growing upset, Sophie yells at him that she's never felt beautiful in her life and runs outside into the Wastes where she begins to cry in the rain. Turnip-head approaches her with an umbrella which cheers her up and Markl runs out to get her. Sophie goes back inside to find Howl slumped over the hearth, his ooze threatening to extinguish Calcifer, and tells a worried Markl that he's just throwing a tantrum. Sophie helps him up and carts him upstairs where she instructs Markl to clean him.\\n\\nHowl is put to bed and rests as Sophie comes in, offering him some warm milk, which he silently refuses. As she gets up to leave, Howl asks her to stay. He explains that the Witch of the Wastes is looking for him and admits that he's a coward for hiding, which is what most of his magic is put towards. When Sophie inquires, Howl says that, at one time, the Witch was very beautiful and Howl decided to pursue her only to find out that she really wasn't. So he ran away. Sophie sighs in exasperation and Howl says that he knows he can't hide for much longer now that both of his pseudonyms have been summoned to the palace to serve in the war effort. The oath he swore in the Royal Sorcery Academy requires him to answer the summons. Howl claims that the war is folly and asserts that Sophie doesn't understand how these people are despite her belief that the king should know what his subjects think.\\n\\nSuddenly, Howl sits up and proposes that Sophie go to the palace in Kingsbury, pretending to be Pendragon's mother, and convince the king that Howl is of no use to him. Sophie reluctantly agrees. She puts on her hat and Howl uses his magic to bring some color back into her dress. Before she leaves, he gives her a ring to wear that he says will guarantee her safety and promises to follow her in disguise. Though Sophie is skeptical of the plan's success, she tries to figure what kind of disguise Howl may take as she walks towards the palace. She figures a pigeon or a crow would be too flamboyant but, as a small plane flies by with a young lady giggling beside her pilot, Sophie muses the pilot could be Howl. As she continues, she's soon accompanied by a small dog (Daijirô Harada). She asks if it's Howl and takes its weak bark as confirmation.\\n\\nAs she approaches the steps to the palace, two shadow men carrying the Witch of the Wastes' sedan chair come up beside her. The Witch peeks out and thanks Sophie for delivering her note and asks how Howl is. Sophie replies curtly that Howl has been a big baby since she started work for him, so she's come to the palace to request another job. The Witch brags that she's been summoned for her skills in magic and is going to see Madam Suliman (Blythe Danner Japanese: Haruko Katô), the king's sorcerer, who has finally seen what talent the Witch has. Sophie asks, if the Witch is so talented, why she doesn't remove her curse. The Witch responds that she only casts spells and cannot break them, leaving Sophie irritated.\\n\\nAs the shadow men approach the steps to the palace, they trigger a spell which renders them useless. A guard announces that the Witch must continue on foot which she does with frustration. Sophie soon catches up to her but finds that she must carry the dog up the high stairs. Though struggling, she manages to pass the Witch as she trundles upward, sweating profusely. Sophie makes it to the top and asks the Witch why she doesn't just give up, but the Witch refuses saying that she's waited 50 years for a summon since Suliman banished her to the Wastes. By the time the Witch makes it up, she's terribly disheveled and Sophie notes that she looks older. They walk into a lobby together, with the dog in tow, where a lone chair sits. The Witch claims it and sits down, relieved, while Sophie is led into a side passage. Large bulbs around the lobby suddenly light up, casting long shadows on the Witch, forming dark figures. The Witch cries out as they move around her in a circle.\\n\\nThe dog leads Sophie into a large greenhouse where she is introduced to Madam Suliman, seated in a wheelchair. Sophie is surprised to see the dog lie beside Suliman and inquires about him. Suliman tells her his name is Hin, her personal errand dog sent out to escort her. Sophie sighs heavily but keeps to the original story, claiming to be Howl's mother and explaining that he would be rather useless. Suliman is saddened by this news and says that Howl was her last and brightest student until his heart was stolen by a demon. Since then, he's been using his magic for purely selfish reasons and Suliman warns Sophie that, should he continue living as such, he will end up as the Witch of the Wastes. Upon her cue, the Witch is brought in on a dolly, reduced to her normal state as an old woman and deprived of magic. Suliman threatens to force Howl's magic from him if he refuses to honor the summon.\\n\\nSophie stands and says that she understands now why Howl refused to come; Suliman's summon was merely a trap to strip him of his powers. She asserts that Howl may be selfish, but his intentions are pure and he only wants to be free. As she speaks, her appearance gradually fades back to her youthful look. Suliman smiles and says that Sophie is in love with Howl. The statement causes Sophie to recoil and revert back into an old woman. The Witch grabs Sophie's dress, asking for Howl and, though Sophie claims he's not coming, Suliman says that he should, now that she knows his weakness.\\n\\nA propeller craft lands in the grass outside and a tall man climbs off and enters the greenhouse. Suliman addresses him as Majesty and introduces him to Sophie as Howl's mother. The King declares to Suliman that he's decided against using magic to win the war since Suliman's powers shield the palace rather than protecting civilians; a statement that Suliman ironically compliments. At the opposite end of the room, a second King enters, shouting that he's come up with a new battle strategy. When he sees his copy, the real King laughs and praises Suliman on her tricks before leaving. Still smiling, Suliman greets Howl who removes his disguise and grasps Sophie, saying that he's fulfilled his oath and must be leaving. Suliman says she won't allow it and conjures a wave of water to flood the room. The group is transported to an empty realm where the earth appears miles below them. Howl tells Sophie not to look down as the Witch clings to her dress. Suliman appears above them and tells Sophie she's going to show her what Howl truly is. Falling stars surround them and begin to encircle Howl and Sophie, chanting. Howl is painfully forced to transform into his bird state and attempts to attack Suliman before Sophie stops him. Suliman raises her staff and throws it, but Howl leaps up and breaks through the illusion out of the greenhouse. He drops down onto the propeller craft with Sophie and the Witch lands in the back seat. Hin leaps onto the craft and puts himself in the Witch's lap as they fly off.\\n\\nSophie sneers at Hin but decides that they are now too high to dump him as Howl gives her the controls to the aircraft. She struggles to maintain flight but soon gains a handle on it, despite nearly crashing. She asks Howl why he bothered to make her go to the palace if he was going. He responds that he's terrified of Suliman, but Sophie's courage gave him the strength to face her. Seeing that they're being followed by the King's men, Howl tells Sophie he will give her five minutes of invisibility and that her ring will guide her back to the castle. All she needs to do is summon Calcifer. He then separates from the aircraft on a copy to ward off their pursuers.\\n\\nAt the palace, Suliman's wards pull her staff from the chair where Sophie had been sitting and she exclaims that was the most fun she's had in a while. She sends out troops to the shops of both Pendragon and the Wizard Jenkins but, when they break down the doors, they find empty buildings. Meanwhile, Sophie continues to fly in the rain. She passes over her hometown and navigates back into the mountain Wastes. The Witch, holding onto Hin, comments that he is a 'nice doggy' but Sophie refuses to trust him. Up ahead, she sees the castle waiting for them but, unsure of how to land the craft, flies into the castle's mouth where they crash. However, unharmed, they all climb out of the wreckage and Sophie greets Markl.\\n\\nThat night while everyone sleeps, Howl enters the room, hunched over and semi-transparent. Calcifer warns him that he's gone too far before Howl goes upstairs. Sophie wakes, somehow returned to her youth, and notices Howl's footprints on the floor surrounded by feathers. As she picks one up, it dissolves. Worried, she puts on a pair of boots and takes a candle. The footprints on the stairs appear bloodied but Sophie follows them. She walks into Howl's room and finds that it has transformed into a vast tunnel, the walls glittering with his toys and adornments. She follows the tunnel until she comes upon Howl, breathing heavily and curled up in his bird-form. He tells her to go away but she refuses and tells him that she can help him break his curse. He says that she can't even break the one on her and Sophie tells him she loves him. Claiming she's too late, Howl stands, revealing a disfigured face full of sharp teeth and flies away, leaving Sophie calling for him, once again an old woman.\\n\\nSophie suddenly awakens and hears the bath water running. She asks Calcifer if Howl is back and he replies that she needs to hurry to break their curse; Howl is getting worse. Frustrated, Sophie asks if Howl is really a monster. Calcifer can't answer any details but reveals that if he is extinguished, Howl will die too. Later, Markl and Turnip-head pitch in to help Sophie remove the propeller plane from the wall of the castle. Once the blockage is cleared, Howl comes down the stairs, looking cheery. Upon seeing Turnip-head, he detects a strong spell on him too and says that it seems everyone in their growing family has problems. He draws a large chalk circle with magical symbols on the ground outside and instructs Calcifer to move the castle over it. He then draws a smaller copy inside and takes Calcifer off the hearth with a shovel. He stands over the circle and Calcifer uses his demon powers to help Howl reconfigure the room. When all is done, Howl shows Sophie the new additions including her own room which looks exactly like the one in her hometown above the hat shop. Outside their door is a courtyard that leads to a new flower shop that Sophie can manage. Seeing everything, she becomes youthful again and is touched by Howl's kindness; though he merely wants everyone to live comfortably. He shows her a new doorway on the color turn-knob that leads to a field covered in flowers. A lone cottage stands near a stream and Howl explains that it used to belong to his uncle, a powerful wizard, who gave it to him so that he could study sorcery in peace. Now, he's giving it to Sophie.\\n\\nFearful that he is leaving, Sophie begs him to stay and says that she wants to help him, even if she's not talented or pretty. When Howl assures her that she's beautiful, she becomes old again. Suddenly, a large warship passes over them. Angered by its presence, Howl lightly gestures and causes the ship to malfunction. This display of magic causes his arm to painfully transform and feather, though Howl tries to hide it. When the airship yields flying creatures, Howl grabs Sophie and sprouts wings, carrying her back to the door to the castle. He drops her inside and flies away. Markl and Hin find Sophie on the stairway by the door exclaiming that she's too old for these shenanigans. That night, before bed, Markl tells Sophie not to worry about Howl; he's often away for days at a time, as Sophie puts the Witch to bed. Before she can leave, the Witch tells Sophie she knows she's in love and her sighing has given her away. Sophie asks the Witch if she has ever fallen in love, to which the Witch gleefully replies that she still is and simply can't ignore the hearts of handsome young men. An air raid siren sounds outside and the Witch warns Sophie not to go out; Sulimans henchmen are no doubt looking for the house although Calcifer keeps the place well hidden.\\n\\nThe next day, after returning from market, Markl rushes into the courtyard and tells Sophie that a strange woman has followed him inside. Sophie looks up to see her mother who rushes forward in tears, crying that she's been looking everywhere for her. Sophie invites her in and her mother reveals that she's gotten married again. She sets a small bag on a table that the Witch, sitting nearby, quickly notices. When Sophie and her mother go into the courtyard again, the Witch takes the bag and grabs a peeping bug that Suliman must have stored in there to spy on Howl. She feeds it to Calcifer who belches sickly. The Witch finds a cigar within the bag and begins to smoke it, much to Hin's disgust. Sophie's mother invites her to live with her but Sophie politely refuses, claiming to be happy where she is. She says farewell to her mother who leaves with a chauffeur. As they drive off, she tells the driver that she did as she was told and must now return to her husband. She whispers for Sophie to forgive her. Sophie goes back into the castle where Markl tells her that he loves her and doesn't want her to leave. Sophie assures him that she will stay; they are a family.\\n\\nThat evening, Sophie attempts to reignite Calcifer who has weakened due to the cigar smoke. Markl goes to open a window but the Witch warns against it, saying that there's an air raid and Calcifer is too weak to properly protect the house. As Sophie goes to pull Markl back from the window, a series of bombs hits the side streets, sending a tremor through the house. Sophie runs outside to see most of the street enveloped in flames and a horde of Suliman's blob men approaching her. She runs back to the courtyard and looks up in time to see a bomb plummeting towards her, with Howl holding onto it. The bomb hits the center of the courtyard but fails to explode. Sophie runs to Howl who apologizes for not arriving sooner and escorts Sophie back into the house. Howl calls up Calcifer, coughing back to life, and takes the cigar from the Witch who says that she needs to have a chat at some point with Howl. He tells Sophie to wait at the house while he goes to deflect the second wave of bombs but she begs him to stay. He tells her he's tired of running and now has something that he wants to protect (Sophie) before flying out the door and into the ember filled sky.\\n\\nSophie retreats inside from the shadow blobs and changes the knob beside the door to return to the Wastes. She then goes outside to watch the battle and sees Howl attacking an airship, now more monstrous than human. She watches in horror as the ship goes down and explodes in a fireball. Sophie demands that Calcifer do something, but he can't change the portals without Howl's help. Sophie begs him to try so that Howl won't have a reason to fight for the shop and states that their vulnerability won't change no matter where they are. They come up with an idea. Markl and Turnip-head help the Witch leave the house and Sophie places Calcifer on a shovel. She backs out of the house with him and watches as the entire castle falls apart. They all go back inside and Sophie puts Calcifer on the hearth, ordering him to move what little is left of the castle closer to Howl so they can help him. However, he is too weak and asks Sophie to give him something of hers. She offers him her long braid and he eats it, gaining strength enough to put together a wobbly, smaller version of the castle. Sophie commends his powers and Calcifer quips her on what he could have done with her eyes or her heart.\\n\\nAt this, the Witch suddenly realizes that Calcifer has Howl's heart. Blindly motivated by her crush, she takes Calcifer off the hearth and holds the heart close to her. The castle shakes and stumbles and the Witch is set on fire, crying out in the heat. Calcifer yells out as his powers are stripped and Sophie tries to take him from the Witch but she refuses to let go. In her panic, Sophie throws water over them which extinguishes the fire. Then, the section of castle Sophie is standing on breaks away from the rest. Hin leaps into her arms as they fall into a deep chasm, Markl calling after her while the castle continues on its way across the mountains.\\n\\nSophie wakes up, having survived the wreck, and is approached by Hin. She bursts out crying, wondering if she killed Howl by pouring water over Calcifer. She buries her face in her hands as the ring Howl gave her begins to tremble, a single beam of light shining from it. Sophie asks the ring if Howl is still alive and it points to the main door that had fallen away, propped against a wall of dirt. She opens it, finding a looming darkness ahead and walks through, Hin following. Sophie finds herself in Howl's cottage and walks outside to the fields where she sees a young boy watching a shower of falling stars; each one perishing as it lands. Realizing the doorway was a portal to Howl's childhood, Sophie runs towards the young Howl and watches as he catches a star, speak to it, and swallow it. He coughs and brings forth from his chest a beating flame; Calcifer. The ring on Sophie's finger breaks and Sophie is plunged into a deep darkness, but manages to shout out to Howl, telling him that she can help him and to find her in the future.\\n\\nSophie and Hin make it back through the doorway where they find Howl waiting for her, nearly a complete form of a monstrous bird. Sophie approaches him, brushes the feathers from his face and kisses him, apologizing for taking so long. She asks him to take them to Calcifer and, as she stands on his clawed foot, Howl takes off. They arrive at the walking castle where Markl, the Witch, and Turnip-head are waiting; the castle having been reduced to two walking legs supporting a single piece of floor. As soon as they arrive, Howl collapses and the feathers disintegrate to reveal his human body. Sophie props him up before going to the Witch and begging her to release Calcifer. Though she refuses at first, with Sophie's plea, she finally relinquishes him to her. Calcifer tells Sophie he's very tired but may be all right if Sophie is the one to give Howl his heart back. She presses him into Howl's chest. A light bursts from it and Calcifer, once again a star, flies off shouting that he's free.\\n\\nWith Calcifer gone, the castle stops moving and begins to tip over. The legs fall apart and the flooring slides quickly down the mountainside. Turnip-head leaps ahead of the floorboard and uses his pole to slow it down, but splinters and grinds it down to near nothing. The floorboard finally stops, propped between two rocks. Proud by his sacrifice, Sophie kisses Turnip-head which suddenly causes him to vibrate and transform into a human. He bows to Sophie and proclaims that he's the prince (English: Crispin Freeman Japanese: Yô Ôizumi) from the neighboring country who had gone missing. A spell had turned him into a scarecrow and a kiss from his true love was the only thing that could break it.\\n\\nThe Witch compliments the handsome young man as Howl awakens and complains of a weight on his chest. Sophie tells him that a heart is a heavy burden and, when he looks at her and likens her hair to starlight, hugs him fiercely. The Witch tells the prince that, though his love is in love with someone else, he should still go home and put an end to the war. He agrees to do this, saying that even hearts can change, and the Witch suggests that she'll be waiting for him should he return. As the prince leaves, Hin sends a visual message to Suliman who asks him where he's been. As he shows her, she begrudgingly calls him a traitor and watches as he rejoins Sophie and Howl. She admits that her fun is at an end and decides to finally put a stop to the war.\\n\\nCalcifer returns to Sophie and ignites into a flame, telling her that he's missed them. Sophie kisses him as well and Howl creates a new, flying home for them all to live in. The Witch sits in the courtyard while Markl and Hin play and Sophie and Howl stand together at the bow of the castle and share a tender kiss.\", 'A boy called Andy Davis (voice: John Morris) uses his toys to act out a bank robbery. The bank is a cardboard box, the robber is Mr. Potato Head (voice: Don Rickles) assisted by Slinky Dog (voice: Jim Varney), and the bystanders include Bo Peep (voice: Annie Potts) and her sheep. The day is saved by cowboy doll Woody (voice: Tom Hanks) playing the sheriff, with help from Rex the dinosaur (voice: Wallace Shawn). Woody is the only toy who gets to say his own lines because he has a pull-string that makes him say things like \"Reach for the sky!\" and \"You\\'re my favorite deputy!\"\\n\\nDuring the opening credits (soundtrack: Randy Newman\\'s \"You\\'ve Got a Friend in Me\"), Andy takes Woody downstairs to find his mother (voice: Laurie Metcalf) decorating the dining room for his birthday party. He asks if they can leave the decorations up until they move, and his mom agrees. She says the guests will arrive soon and sends him back upstairs to get his baby sister Molly (voice: Hannah Unkrich), whose crib is in his room. Andy tosses Woody onto his bed before he pulls Molly out of her crib and carries her away.\\n\\nWoody and the other toys have seemed limp and inanimate up to this point, but as soon as Andy leaves the room, Woody sits up and expresses surprise that the birthday party is today. He calls \"Ok, everybody, the coast is clear,\" and the other toys come to life too. Woody calls a staff meeting and tells Slinky Dog to spread the word. Within a few minutes (during which Bo Peep makes a date with Woody for that evening), all the toys are assembled. Woody starts by reminding them all to find a moving buddy so they don\\'t get lost when the Davis family moves to their new house, which will happen in a week. Then he tries to downplay the news that Andy\\'s birthday party is happening today, but it causes a commotion as the toys know that Andy\\'s actual birthday isn\\'t till next week. Rex worries that someone will give Andy another dinosaur, and many of the toys have similar concerns. Woody points out that it makes sense to have the party before the move, then tries to calm them down. He\\'s interrupted when Hamm (voice: John Ratzenberger) the piggybank, stationed near the window, announces that the guests are arriving. The toys rush to the window to see the presents the kids are bringing; the bigger boxes make them especially nervous. Hamm predicts \"we\\'re next month\\'s garage sale fodder for sure.\" Woody finally says, \"If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?\"\\n\\nSending out the troops means that the little green plastic soldiers, led by Sarge (voice: R. Lee Ermey), lower the baby monitor to the first floor and hide with it in a potted plant, where they can observe the opening of the gifts and report back to the toys in Andy\\'s room. At first, the presents seem nonthreatening &mdash; a lunchbox, bed sheets (\"who invited that kid?\" wonders Mr. Potato Head), a Battleship game. But Andy\\'s mom pulls a surprise present from the closet. Andy\\'s very excited about it, but before they hear what it is, Rex knocks the speaker off the table and the batteries fall out. Sarge warns that the kids are headed upstairs, but the toys barely have time to resume their previous positions before the stampede thunders in. One of the kids (Andy?) sweeps Woody off the bed, saying \"make a space, this is where the spaceship lands!\" They put something down where Woody was, then Andy\\'s mom calls them back down to play games and suddenly the room is empty again. The toys creep out of their hiding places to see the new toy, pausing in surprise when Woody crawls out from under the bed. The new toy has taken Woody\\'s place on the bed, which causes consternation. Woody reminds them that no one is being replaced, and they look up to see what\\'s on the bed.\\n\\nIt\\'s Buzz Lightyear (voice: Tim Allen), space ranger, Universe Protection unit. Buzz believes he\\'s crash landed on a strange planet on the way to sector 12, and his ship (his box) is damaged. Woody welcomes Buzz to Andy\\'s room and tries to explain that Buzz has landed in Woody\\'s usual spot. The other toys climb up on the bed to meet Buzz and ask him about the buttons and gadgets on his space suit. They\\'re impressed with Buzz\\'s voice recordings &mdash; \"a quality sound system\" &mdash; not like Woody\\'s pull-string-activated voice, which \"sounds like a car ran over it.\" Buzz also has a laser (\"a little light bulb that blinks,\" grumbles Woody), and wings. Buzz takes exception to being called a toy, and when Woody says he can\\'t really fly, Buzz climbs the bedpost, shouts \"to infinity and beyond!\", and dives. He bounces off a rubber ball, does a loop-de-loop on the racetrack, and gets stuck for a few rotations on the toy plane tethered to the ceiling before flipping down and landing neatly back on the bed. All the toys are dazzled except Woody, who says \"that wasn\\'t flying, that was falling with style!\"\\n\\nIn the montage that follows (soundtrack: Randy Newman\\'s \"Strange Things Are Happening to Me\"), Andy has Buzz shoot Woody, then puts on a cardboard replica of Buzz\\'s helmet and wings. A western-themed poster in Andy\\'s room is replaced by two Buzz Lightyear posters, and drawings of Woody on the bulletin board are covered with drawings of Buzz. The western-style bedspread disappears; the new one is emblazoned with Buzz\\'s image and his name. In the final indignity, Andy takes Buzz to bed and leaves Woody in the covered wagon toy chest.\\n\\nSome alarming noises draw the toys to the open window, where they can see the neighbor kid, Sid (voice: Erik von Detten), who\\'s about to blow up a Combat Carl action figure. Sid\\'s dog Scud, a brown and white bull terrier, is tied up nearby and barking like crazy. Buzz thinks Sid, who\\'s laughing maniacally, is \"a happy child;\" the others explain that he tortures toys. Buzz wants to help the doomed toy soldier, but Sid lights the fuse and Andy\\'s toys duck as debris goes flying. When they look again, there\\'s no sign of Carl. \"The sooner we move, the better,\" says Bo Peep.\\n\\nAndy\\'s mom suggests dinner at Pizza Planet (a space-themed restaurant) and tells Andy he can bring one toy. Doubting that Andy will choose him unless Buzz is unavailable, Woody plans to trap Buzz in a gap behind Andy\\'s desk. The plan backfires and Buzz falls out the window into the bushes below. The other toys accuse Woody of pushing Buzz out the window out of jealousy, but as they are about to punish him, Andy returns. Failing to find Buzz, he grabs Woody and the family drives off &mdash; but not before Buzz crawls out of his bush and climbs on the back of the minivan.\\n\\nWhile Andy\\'s mother refuels the car at a Dinoco station, Woody wonders how he can convince the other toys that Buzz\\'s fall was an accident. Suddenly Buzz appears. Woody is delighted, though more for his own sake than Buzz\\'s (\"I\\'m saved!\"), but Buzz is very bitter over what Woody did to him. The two fight and roll out of the car, which drives off and leaves them stranded. Luckily, Woody sees another vehicle heading for Pizza Planet and knows that they can meet Andy there. He tricks Buzz into coming with him (but only because if he came home without Buzz, the other toys would attack him). Buzz insists on riding in the \"cockpit\" (the front seat) so he can wear a seatbelt; Woody climbs in the back and gets thrown about by the driver\\'s erratic maneuvers. They reach Pizza Planet and hide in discarded food packaging so they can sneak through the front door. Woody quickly spots the Davises, but Buzz climbs into a claw-crane machine shaped like a spaceship, thinking it\\'s the ship home Woody promised him. The machine is filled with three-eyed green aliens (voices: Debi Derryberry, Jeff Pidgeon) who believe the claw is a god. Woody climbs in to get Buzz out, but Woody and Buzz are captured by Sid, along with one of the little aliens.\\n\\nSid takes them back to his house and immediately gives the three-eyed alien to Scud, who starts chewing on it. Then Sid takes a doll away from his little sister Hannah (voice: Sarah Rayne) and runs upstairs to operate on her. (\"No one\\'s ever attempted a double-bypass brain transplant before!\") Woody and Buzz, still in Sid\\'s backpack, look on in horror as Sid replaces the doll\\'s head with the head of a toy pterodactyl and gleefully gives it back to Hannah, who shrieks for her mother and runs away. Sid follows.\\n\\nWoody tries to get out of Sid\\'s room, but the door\\'s locked. He\\'s frightened by Sid\\'s nightmarish mutant toys, which Sid has butchered and reconstructed a la Frankenstein. There\\'s an erector-set spider with a one-eyed baby head, a jack-in-the-box whose jack has been replaced by a green rubber hand, a fishing pole with legs, and other horrors. Buzz thinks they\\'re cannibals. Meanwhile, Andy\\'s toys are searching for Buzz from Andy\\'s window. They have to stop when the car pulls into the driveway. Andy can\\'t find Woody and many of the toys think he ran away, which they interpret as evidence of his guilt. But Bo Peep hopes he\\'s ok.\\n\\nNext morning, Sid interrogates Woody about the location of a \"rebel base.\" When Woody remains silent, Sid uses a magnifying glass to concentrate the sunlight on a spot between Woody\\'s eyebrows, which starts to smoke. Woody is saved when Sid is called away to eat his Pop-tarts. Buzz compliments Woody for not succumbing to Sid\\'s torture. Woody notices that Sid has left the door open, but before he and Buzz get out, the mutant toys block the way. Buzz tries his laser on them and is puzzled when it doesn\\'t work. Woody pushes the button that activates Buzz\\'s karate-chop action and frog-marches him through the crowd of toys, which parts to let them through. Woody drops Buzz as soon as they reach the door and runs down the stairs saying \"there\\'s no place like home, there\\'s no place like home,\" a la Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz (1939).\\n\\nOn the landing, he finds Scud, scary even in his sleep. He backs up, then Buzz grabs him and leads him down the hall past the head of the stairs. But the ring on Woody\\'s pull-string catches on the wrought-iron stair railing, and he says (involuntarily) \"Yee-haw! Giddyap, partner &mdash; we got to get this wagon train a-movin!\" Of course the dog wakes up and comes to investigate. Buzz says \"Split up!\" and runs through an open door; Woody pulls another door closed behind him. Buzz sees someone asleep in a recliner and notices that the television is on. A voice is saying \"Come in, Buzz Lightyear! This is Star Command!\" At first Buzz thinks Star Command is really trying to reach him, and fiddles with the radio on his suit. But as the commercial enumerates his features and adds a disclaimer that Buzz is not a flying toy, Buzz begins to believe that he really is, as Woody keeps telling him, only a child\\'s plaything. He\\'s despondent. Then he spots an open window in the stairwell (apparently nobody in this neighborhood bothers with window screens) and tries to prove himself wrong by flying through it. He bounces off the stairs and lands in the hall, losing an arm in the process (soundtrack: Randy Newman\\'s \"I Will Go Sailing No More\").\\n\\nHannah picks Buzz up and carries him off to her room, where Woody finds him playing the part of Mrs. Nesbitt at a tea party. (\"What a lovely hat, Mrs. Nesbitt. It goes quite well with your head.\") Woody imitates Hannah\\'s mother\\'s voice to lure Hannah out of the room so he can rescue Buzz. Buzz is raving and depressed, but when he wails that he can\\'t even fly out the window, it gives Woody an idea. He opens the window in Sid\\'s room and calls over to Andy\\'s room, where Hamm is beating Mr. Potato Head at Battleship. Most of the toys seem glad to see him. He tosses a string of Christmas lights across and tells them to tie it to something, but Mr. Potato Head says \"How \\'bout we don\\'t?\" and tries to convince the other toys that they should leave Woody where he is. Woody tells them Buzz is with him, but Buzz won\\'t come to the window where the toys in Andy\\'s room can see him, though he does throw Woody his detached arm. Woody uses the arm to make the toys think Buzz is standing next to him, but eventually slips up and they see that the arm isn\\'t attached to Buzz. They react pretty much the way people would react to a severed human arm, with horror and disgust. They let go of the string of lights, which falls to the ground. When Woody begs them to listen, they leave the window, except for Slink, who closes the blinds. Woody cries.\\n\\nDown on the floor, Sid\\'s mutant toys have surrounded Buzz. When Woody tries to drive them off, the baby-headed spider comes at him and takes away Buzz\\'s arm. Woody can\\'t break through the group around Buzz, but he\\'s sure they\\'re killing him until the crowd of toys breaks up and reveals Buzz with his arm re-attached. \"But they\\'re cannibals,\" Woody says; \"we saw them eat those other toys\" ... then he looks at Sid\\'s toys again, and notices that Hannah\\'s doll and the pterodactyl have their own heads back. Realizing hes misjudged them, he\\'s trying to apologize when they all disappear under the bed and Sid comes back.\\n\\nSid has a rocket. His first thought is to use it on Woody, but Woody\\'s hiding, so he picks up Buzz instead. \"I\\'ve always wanted to put a space man into orbit,\" he says malevolently. A rainstorm forces him to delay the rocket launch until morning.\\n\\nNext door, it\\'s Andy\\'s bedtime and he\\'s mourning the loss of his two favorite toys. His mom comes in and says she\\'s looked everywhere, and all she can find is his hat, which she gives him. (This is the white-laced red cowboy hat that looks like the had worn by Jessie, a character we meet in the next movie.) Andy\\'s mom reassures him that they\\'ll find Woody and Buzz before they move out &mdash; tomorrow.\\n\\nThat night, Woody convinces Buzz that even if he\\'s not a space ranger, life as Andy\\'s toy is still worth living, though Woody himself despairs that he\\'ll ever be Andy\\'s favorite toy again. Buzz regains his spirit in time to see the moving truck pull up to Andy\\'s house. But before they can escape, Sid wakes up and takes Buzz (still strapped to the rocket) out into the back yard. He starts working on something ominous with a big empty water jug while doing newscaster-style narration of the preparations for the approaching rocket launch.\\n\\nWoody pleads with the mutant toys to help him rescue Buzz and they hesitantly join him. (None of Sid\\'s toys talk.) Woody outlines a plan and assigns tasks to each toy. Ducky and Legs go into the heating ducts to avoid Scud, who saw Woody trying to follow Sid and is still growling outside the bedroom door. Ducky and Legs get outside by removing the light fixture on the front porch, then ring the doorbell. When he hears the doorbell, Woody releases a wind-up frog from Sid\\'s room; the frog scoots under Scud and zooms down the hall. Scud gives chase and follows the frog downstairs, where Hannah\\'s answering the door. The frog goes out, Ducky grabs it, and they\\'re both reeled up by Legs (who\\'s part fishing pole) before Scud catches up. Hannah, exasperated, shuts the door, leaving Scud outside. The porch light fixture drops back into place before anyone notices it\\'s gone.\\n\\nAs soon as Hannah\\'s out of the front hall, Woody and his cadre of toys come down the stairs, roll through the kitchen, and exit through the cat flap in the back door. They land in the bushes, where they have a good view of the launch site. Sid\\'s newscaster voice is asking his mission control voice if launch pad construction is complete; mission control says it is. Sid himself is out of sight, apparently rummaging around in the shed looking for matches. Ducky, Legs, and the wind-up frog pop out of a down-spout as Sid prepares to start the count-down.\\n\\nThe launch pad looks very strange. Buzz and his rocket are standing on a dart board on a milk crate. Nearby is an orange-striped traffic horse with a rake leaning on it and the empty water jug propped underneath. The jug is connected with vacuum-cleaner hose to a red funnel, which is aimed at Buzz\\'s feet.\\n\\nWoody approaches Buzz, who\\'s happy to see him and asks for help getting loose. Woody says \"Everything\\'s under control,\" and falls to the ground in the manner of a toy expecting a human on the scene. Sure enough, Sid comes out of the shed using his mission control voice (\"all systems are go, requesting permission to launch\") &mdash; and then notices Woody. He tosses Woody on the charcoal grill and says \"You and I can have a cookout later.\" He puts a match in Woody\\'s holster and turns back to his rocket launch, where he lights another match and starts counting down from 10. While he\\'s focused on this, toys are taking up positions all around the yard.\\n\\nBefore Sid can light Buzz\\'s fuse, Woody\\'s voice recordings start playing, one after another: \"Reach for the sky! This town ain\\'t big enough for the two of us! Somebody\\'s poisoned the waterhole!\" Sid is distracted and comes over to pick Woody up off the grill. His string hasn\\'t been pulled.\\n\\n\"It\\'s busted!\" he says disgustedly.\\n\\n\"Who are you callin\\' busted, buster?\" says Woody. \"That\\'s right, I\\'m talking to you, Sid Phillips. We don\\'t like being blown up, Sid.\" Sid begins to look terrified. \"... or smashed, or ripped apart,\" continues Woody.\\n\\n\"W-we?\" Sid stutters.\\n\\n\"That\\'s right!\" replies Woody. \"Your toys!\" A rag doll climbs out of the sandbox and walks across the yard saying \"ma-ma ... ma-ma.\" A large toy pickup truck emerges from a pile of sand while a couple of partially dismembered soldier action figures rise out of a puddle. They all advance on Sid, who backs away and jumps when the three-eyed alien from Pizza Planet pops out from under Scud\\'s red water bowl. Sid backs toward the clothes line and the baby-headed spider drops down on his head. He shrieks and shakes it off, but the toys have him surrounded now. Woody says, \"You must take good care of your toys, because if you don\\'t, we\\'ll find out, Sid. We toys can see everything!\" Woody\\'s head spins all the way around (think The Exorcist (1973)). \"So play nice.\"\\n\\nSid is panic-stricken. He screams, throws Woody in the air, and runs into the house, where he tells Hannah the toys are alive. When he sees the doll she\\'s carrying, he says \"nice toy,\" and backs away. She waves the doll at him. He screams again and runs upstairs crying; she chases him.\\n\\nOutside, Woody and other toys are celebrating. \"We did it!\" As Buzz thanks Woody, they hear a honk from next door. Andy\\'s mom tells the kids to say goodbye to their old house and the minivan starts to move. Woody and Buzz rush over and Woody climbs on the back of the car, but Buzz, still burdened with the rocket, can\\'t get through the fence. He tells Woody he\\'ll catch up, but Woody comes back for him. They manage to get on the back of the moving van, but Scud runs after them and gets hold of Woody\\'s leg. Woody can\\'t hold on to the truck and tells Buzz to take care of Andy for him. Buzz, sacrificing himself to save Woody, jumps on Scud\\'s head, making him let go of Woody. Woody climbs back on the truck and pries open the cargo door as the truck comes to a stoplight. Woody pulls out RC, the remote controlled car, and sends him to get Buzz, who\\'s under a parked car where Scud can\\'t reach him.\\n\\nThe toys in the van think Woody is murdering another toy and try to stop him. This is a problem because Woody\\'s controlling RC. The angry toys pick up Woody and Rocky, the strong-man, spins him around, which causes RC to drive in circles around Scud (who\\'s still barking furiously). They throw Woody against a box; RC\\'s path straightens out. Hamm jumps on Woody. RC, with Buzz still precariously aboard, approaches a busy intersection. The traffic light is not in their favor. RC scoots under a moving car, but two other cars collide while trying to avoid Scud. The wrecked cars cut the dog off from his quarry and RC pulls away.\\n\\nOn the truck, Woody tries to tell the toys that Buzz is out there and they have to save him, but Mr. Potato Head isn\\'t buying it. \"Toss him overboard,\" he says, and they do &mdash; but Woody holds on to RC\\'s controller. RC sweeps Woody off his feet and Woody turns RC up to turbo so they can catch up to the moving truck.\\n\\nLenny (voice: Joe Ranft), the binoculars, notices RC and his passengers gaining on them and alerts the other toys. Bo Peep confirms that Buzz is there &mdash; \"Woody was telling the truth!\"\\n\\n\"What have we done?\" wail the toys. Bo Peep tells Rocky to lower the truck\\'s cargo ramp. Slink stretches out and Woody is able to grab his paw just as RC\\'s batteries begin to lose strength.\\n\\nIn the Davises\\' car, they\\'re listening to \"Hakuna Matata.\" Molly can see RC in the side mirror and laughs, but she can\\'t talk, so no one else notices. RC is swerving dangerously. Slink, stretched past his limit, loses his grip and RC coughs to a stop in the middle of the road as the moving van disappears in the distance. Then Buzz remembers he still has a rocket strapped to his back, and Woody remembers he still has the match Sid put in his holster. He strikes it and is about to light Buzz\\'s fuse when the wind of a passing car puts out the match. Despair. But when Woody\\'s hand starts to smoke, he realizes that Buzz\\'s helmet concentrates the sunlight just as Sid\\'s magnifying glass did. They use it to light the fuse. The rocket catches them up to the truck and lifts them off the ground. As they go by Woody drops RC, who lands in the truck. Buzz and Woody go straight up with the rocket. Buzz opens his wings, which apparently break the tape holding him to the rocket, and zooms downward. He\\'s still clutching Woody, who says \"Buzz, you\\'re flying!\"\\n\\n\"This isn\\'t flying, this is falling with style!\" retorts Buzz, repeating Woody\\'s earlier line. They pass the truck again and fall through the minivan\\'s sunroof, landing neatly in the box next to Andy, who finds them and gleefully tells his mom. She assumes they\\'ve been in the car the whole time.\\n\\nOn Christmas Eve at the new house, Andy, Molly, and their mom are gathered around the Christmas tree. The army men are hiding in the tree with the baby monitor; the other toys are in Andy\\'s room gathered around the speaker. Bo Peep pulls Woody under some mistletoe (held by her sheep) and kisses him. Andy\\'s bed still sports a Buzz Lightyear bedspread, but one of the pillowcases and the comforter at the foot of the bed are western style. Drawings of Woody are again prominent on the bulletin board. There are two Buzz Lightyear posters, but also a cowboy poster. Balance and harmony reign.\\n\\nAll the toys seem happy and relaxed; instead of fretting that Andy might get another dinosaur, Rex hopes for a leaf-eater so he can play the dominant predator.\\n\\nThe first report comes in from Sarge: Molly\\'s first present is a Mrs. Potato Head, to Mr. Potato Head\\'s delight. He says he\\'d better shave and yanks off his mustache.\\n\\nWoody, a bit lipstick-stained and woozy, joins Buzz on Andy\\'s bed. They\\'re still friends. Sarge announces that Andy\\'s opening his first present, but there\\'s a burst of static and Buzz whacks the speaker a few times. Woody asks Buzz if he\\'s worried and Buzz denies it, then says, \"Are you?\"\\n\\n\"Now Buzz,\" Woody teases, \"what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?.\"\\n\\nThen they hear a bark downstairs, and Andy\\'s joyous cry of \"wow, a puppy!\" Woody and Buzz exchange nervous smiles. The credits roll to the reprise of \"You\\'ve Got a Friend in Me,\" a duet featuring Randy Newman and Lyle Lovett.', 'The city of Monstropolis in a world entirely populated by monsters is powered by energy from the screams of human children. At the Monsters, Inc., factory, skilled monsters employed as \"scarers\" venture into the human world to scare children and harvest their screams, through doors that activate portals to children\\'s bedroom closets.\\n\\nThe factory has a huge warehouse containing thousands of doors, work areas called \"scare floors\" where the doors are activated and the energy from the screams of human children are contained in energy containers, and a simulator room in which employees practice their scare skills in a simulator. Work at the factory is considered dangerous, as human children are believed to be toxic.\\n\\nThe story takes place in Monstropolis, a city populated entirely by monsters. Monstropolis is not part of the human world, but it can be connected to children\\'s bedrooms through their closet doors. When a door is properly activated, it becomes a portal between the monster world and the human world. The city\\'s power supply is provided by Monsters, Inc., a utility company that employs monsters to scare children and extract energy from their screams. The company has a huge warehouse full of doors, work areas called \"scare floors\" where the doors are activated, and a special training room in which employees practice their scare skills. The company\\'s best scarer is James P. \"Sully\" Sullivan (Goodman), whose assistant is his best friend, Michael \"Mike\" Wazowski (Crystal). Sulley\\'s main rival is Randall Boggs (Buscemi), and the company\\'s CEO is Henry J. Waternoose III (Coburn). Monstropolis is in the middle of an energy crisis because children are harder to scare than they used to be.\\n\\nOne day, Sully finds an activated door on his scare floor after the workday has ended. He finds no one in the room behind the door, but a little two-year-old girl (Gibbs) follows him back into the monster world. Far from being scared, she calls him \"Kitty\" and delights in playing with him. Since monsters believe humans are lethally toxic, Sully tries repeatedly to return the girl to her room, but she keeps following him back, and Randall eventually deactivates and stores the door, leaving the girl stuck in the monster world. The girl\\'s presence becomes public knowledge after Sully sneaks her into a restaurant to find Mike, so they hide her in Sully\\'s home while the Child Detection Agency (CDA) searches for her. Sully eventually names the girl \"Boo\", and he slowly bonds with her after realizing that she is not poisonous. He also discovers that her laughter produces even more energy than her screams.\\n\\nThe next morning, Sully and Mike disguise Boo in a monster costume and sneak her into work. Randall agrees to help them return her to her bedroom, but when Mike enters the room, Randall captures him in a box, believing he is Boo. Randall intends to kidnap Boo and subject her to a device that extracts her screams.\\n\\nWhat follows is a sequence of battles, chases, and mishaps in which Sully and Mike attempt to protect Boo from Randall and his scream machine. Waternoose reveals that he is in cahoots with Randall and banishes Sully and Mike to the Himalayas, where they meet the Abominable Snowman (John Ratzenberger), but Sully and Mike return to the monster world through a village at the foot of the mountain, where Randall chases them through the company\\'s roller-coaster-like door-moving system. When the energy in Boo\\'s laughter activates the doors in storage, the chase passes in and out of the human world. Finally, Sully and Boo defeat Randall. Sully throws Randall through the door of a trailer-park trailer, where a woman beats Randall with a shovel, and Mike destroys the door to make sure Randall never comes back.\\n\\nJust as Sully and Mike attempt to return Boo to her home, Waternoose and the CDA call her door to the scare floor, ready to arrest them, but Mike leads the agents away by fleeing with Boo\\'s monster costume, and Sully escapes with Boo and the door. When Waternoose follows Sully and Boo, Sulley attempts to set up and activate the door, and when Waternoose follows them through the door, he tells Sully he is willing to kidnap children in order to save the company. However, Sully had not properly activated Boo\\'s door, causing the three to actually wind up in the adjacent Monsters, Inc. training room, which is equipped with a video monitoring system. Mike has recorded Waternoose\\'s confession, and after he replays the confession, CDA agents arrest Waternoose.\\n\\nWith the scream-machine plot foiled, the CDA agents call in their leader, who has been working undercover as Roz (Bob Peterson), the company\\'s bookkeeper. Mike says goodbye to Boo and Sully returns her to her bedroom, then Roz has the door shredded, preventing monsters from ever visiting Boo again. Sully keeps one of the wood splinters as a memento.\\n\\nSome time later, Sully is the CEO of Monsters, Inc., and the company has ended the energy crisis with his policy of making children laugh instead of scaring them. Meanwhile, Mike has collected and reassembled the pieces of Boo\\'s shredded door. When Sully puts his piece in its place, the door is activated again, and when he peeks into Boo\\'s room, she greets him.\\n\\nThe credits (theatrical version) or bonus features (home video) include a series of simulated outtakes and an amateur stage performance played by Mike and other Monsters, Inc. employees.', 'Riley is a girl born in Minnesota. Five emotions live inside her head. They are responsible for her actions and make her memories. The memories are kept as balls. They each give a different color depending on the emotion of the memory. The most important memories are core memories that power islands of personality. They reflect a different aspect of Riley\\'s life. Joy makes Riley happy. Fear keeps her safe. Disgust prevents her from being poisoned, physically and socially. Anger makes her life fair. Sadness however, doesn\\'t seem to have a purpose. She\\'s ignored as a result.\\n\\nRiley turns eleven. Her parents move to San Francisco. Sadness has a magical touch. When she touches a memory, it turns sad and blue, and it can\\'t be changed back to what it was before. Joy forbids Sadness from touching any more memories until she finds out what\\'s going on. The first day at the new school, Joy has Sadness stand inside a circle so she can\\'t spread her gloominess. Riley talks about her life in Minnesota. Joy brings up a memory and has it played on a projector in Riley\\'s head. Sadness wanders outside her circle and touches the memory, turning it sad. While the emotions are trying to remove the memory from the projector, Sadness takes control of the console, making Riley cry in front of her classmates. A new core memory is created. This core memory is sad and blue. Riley\\'s only had happy core memories before. Joy sees sad memories as a bad thing. She tries to get rid of it. Sadness tries to stop her, saying it\\'s a core memory. In their struggle, all the core memories are knocked from the holder they\\'re kept in. Joy, Sadness and the core memories are sucked up the tube, into the far depths of Riley\\'s mind.\\n\\nJoy and Sadness are in Long Term Memory, a labyrinth of corridors of shelves of memories. They meet Riley\\'s former imaginary friend Bing Bong, who\\'s desperate to reconnect with Riley. He says the Train of Thought can take them back to Headquarters. Their journey takes them through Abstract Thought and Imagination Land. Parts of Preschool World are being demolished, Princess Dream World and the Stuffed Animal Hall of Fame. Mind workers are taking Bing Bong\\'s song-powered rocket to the Memory Dump, a deep pit where obsolete memories are erased. A plow pushes the rocket into the dump. Bing Bong is really upset over the loss of his rocket. He\\'s completely unresponsive when Joy tries to cheer him up. Sadness listens to what Bing Bong has to say. He and Riley had great adventures together. They were best friends. It\\'s sad. Bing Bong hugs Sadness. He cries candy. He\\'s okay now. He continues to take the emotions to the train station. Joy wonders how did Sadness do that?\\n\\nIn Headquarters, Fear, Anger and Disgust try to take charge in Joy\\'s absence. They\\'re unable to make Riley happy. Dinner ends in disaster. The father sends Riley to her room for her rude, disrespectful behavior. Later that evening, the father can\\'t cheer Riley up with his monkey noises. Riley dumps her best friend and quits hockey. Goofball Island, Friendship Island and Hockey Island fall into the Memory Dump. Anger comes up with the idea: Riley\\'s happy core memories were made in Minnesota. The only way for her to be happy is to return there and make more.\\n\\nJoy, Sadness and Bing Bong are on the Train of Thought. Unfortunately, the train does not run while Riley\\'s asleep. They enter Dream Productions. Joy\\'s idea is to wake Riley up with exhilaration, excite her awake. A dog costume, Joy is in the front. Sadness is in the back. Bing Bong lets down a brightly colored curtain and balloons. The dog costume is ripped in half, but due to the reality distortion filter, it looks as if a real dog has split in two in the dream. Despite all this, Riley stays asleep. Security men capture Bing Bong and take him to the Subconscious, a place where they keep Riley\\'s deepest, darkest fears. Bing Bong is trapped in a cage of balloons, on the belly of a giant, sleeping birthday clown named Jangles. Joy frees Bing Bong. Before they leave, Joy and Sadness wake up Jangles who chases them into Dream Productions. Fear is on dream duty. The sight of Jangles really scares him and wakes up Riley. The train is running again.\\n\\nBing Bong picks out a memory. It\\'s the time in the twisty tree. Mom and Dad and the hockey team are cheering Riley. Sadness loves this memory too. \"It was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful. She wanted to quit.\"\\n\\nAnger carries out his idea to run away. Riley is led to steal her mother\\'s credit card to pay for her travel expenses. Honesty Island crumbles. The crumbling island bashes into the railway line of the Train of Thought. The train crashes against Long Term Memory. Mind workers rescue Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong from the train, before it falls into the Memory Dump. The three characters find a recall tube. When Sadness tries to get in the tube, the core memories start to turn blue. Joy thinks Riley should be happy. She closes the tube and starts to get sucked up, leaving Sadness and Bing Bong behind. As Long Term Memory crumbles and breaks away, the recall tube shatters. Joy and Bing Bong fall into the Memory Dump.\\n\\nJoy finds the sad core memory. She looks back over Riley\\'s obsolete memories. She just wanted Riley to be happy. She picks up the twisty tree memory and rewinds it to find it\\'s sad at the beginning. Sadness\\' words echo \"It was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful. She wanted to quit.\" Mom and Dad and the team, they came to help because of Sadness. Joy and Bing Bong find the song-powered rocket. They try to use it to escape the dump, but the rocket falls short each time. The third time they power up the rocket, Bing Bong gets out of the rocket at the last second, allowing Joy to escape the dump. Bing Bong thanks Joy for letting him be important one last time, before fading away. In Headquarters, the emotions discover running away was a bad idea. Family Island, the last remaining island starts to break apart and fall. The console starts to shut itself down and become inactive. Riley becomes completely unresponsive to the emotions\\' commands. They can\\'t make Riley feel anything. They\\'re also unable to remove the idea bulb to run away.\\n\\nJoy looks around for Sadness, but Sadness now believes her actions only hurt Riley. She\\'s floating around on a rain cloud. The imaginary boyfriend generator, imaginary boyfriend says he would die for Riley. It\\'s time for him to prove it. Joy has the machine make lots of copies of imaginary boyfriends. She unties a balloon and lets the air out, blowing it towards Sadness so her cloud floats towards Headquarters. Joy builds a ladder of imaginary boyfriends. She\\'s standing on top of the ladder. She lets the ladder fall down. She bounces off a Family Island trampoline. She\\'s flying through the air over the Memory Dump. She grabs Sadness. The two emotions hit against the window of Headquarters. Anger throws a chair at the window. The window does not break. Disgust provokes Anger so that he gets really angry. He\\'s the Anger emotion. When he\\'s really angry, fire bursts from his head. Disgust uses his flaming head to burn a hole in the window and let Joy and Sadness in.\\n\\nSadness is magically able to remove the idea bulb, so Riley comes home. Joy allows Sadness to touch the core memories so they all turn sad. She allows Sadness to play the sad memories in the projector in Riley\\'s head. Sadness takes control of the console. A tearful Riley admits she misses Minnesota. She wants her old friends and her hockey team. The parents need her to be happy, but she wants to go home. The parents are not angry. They miss Minnesota too, the woods where they took hikes, the backyard where she used to play and Spring Lake where she learned to skate. The parents hug Riley deeply. Sadness takes Joy\\'s hand and they both press a button together. A new core memory is created. This core memory is yellow and blue, happy and sad.\\n\\nSadness has finally found a place to work alongside her fellow emotions. They have a new expanded console. The core memories are a mixture of emotions now. Riley has new friends and a new house. She\\'s twelve now. What could happen?', \"Young Carl Fredricksen (Jeremy Leary), a quiet bespectacled boy wearing an old pilot's cap and goggles, watches a film reel in a theater depicting his hero Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), a famous explorer. The reporter speaks of Muntz's various accomplishments and discoveries before commenting that he was recently dishonored by scientists who believed his latest find, the large skeleton of a bird, was a hoax. Intent on proving them wrong, Muntz is seen boarding his zeppelin with his team of dogs and promises to return once he has brought back living proof of his find. After the show, Carl runs down the street with his balloon, named after Muntzs zeppelin The Spirit of Adventure. He passes an old, rundown house where he hears someone shout out Muntz's famous slogan: Adventure is out there!\\n\\nCarl goes inside to investigate and meets a young, outgoing tomboy who shares his passion for exploration and admiration of Charles Muntz. Startled by her loud, boyish demeanor at first, Carl loses his balloon in the rafters. The girl, Ellie (Elie Docter), helps him retrieve it, though Carl falls from a beam and breaks his arm. Ellie sneaks into his room that night and shows him her adventure book where she expresses a desire to one day move to the top of Paradise Falls in South America, showing him a picture that she 'ripped right out of a library book'. She makes him promise that they will go together someday before leaving. A musical montage shows Carl and Ellie eventually getting married and moving into the old house where they first met. Their marriage is blissful and they get jobs as a balloon salesman and zookeeper, respectively. When they discover that Ellie is unable to have children, they make a pact to save money to travel to Paradise Falls. However, as the years pass, they are forced to dig into their Falls fund for other obligations. One day, an elderly Carl realizes that, despite living happily together, they never fulfilled their old promise and decides to surprise Ellie on a picnic with tickets to South America. However, Ellie's declining health puts her in the hospital and she eventually passes away, leaving Carl alone.\\n\\nCarl remains in his home, a retired and sour recluse, as the city grows around him. He is encouraged to move to a retirement home due to increased construction, but often argues with the foreman (John Ratzenberger) and refuses to leave. One day, he meets Russell (Jordan Nagai), a young wilderness explorer scout who attempts to assist Carl in order to earn his 'assisting the elderly' badge. Carl tricks Russell into 'assisting' him by telling him to find and get rid of a 'snipe' that invades his yard. When a construction worker accidentally breaks Carl's mailbox, a part of the house and a part of Ellie that Carl cherishes, Carl hits him over the head with his walker. The assault lands him in court where he is forced to move out of his home by the next day. Workers from Shady Oaks retirement home arrive to pick him up the following morning but are shocked to find Carl releasing millions of helium balloons into the air which detach his house from its foundation, lifting it over the city and into the sky.\\n\\nComfortably away from the city, Carl sets a course for South America and rests in his chair until hes interrupted by a knock at the door. Upon answering, he discovers Russell hanging on to dear life on his porch; apparently, Russell had been snipe searching under Carls porch. Carl lets him in and decides to descend to return Russell home before a severe storm hits. The house is knocked around in the turbulence but Carl manages to tie most of his items down before falling asleep. He's woken the next morning by Russell, who tells him that they're over South America (thanks to a GPS device that he accidentally throws out the window), though the ground is hidden by a dense fog. Carl releases some balloons to descend but they hit ground early and are knocked out of the house. They manage to hold onto it using a hose attached to the porch while the fog lifts to reveal that they are standing on a high plateau opposite Paradise Falls. Unable to climb back into the house, they resolve to walk to the falls before the helium in the balloons lets out.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a chase is progressing in the jungle. Three dogs with red lights on their collars are in hot pursuit of what appears to be a giant bird, but they lose the trail when their sensitive ears pick up the fine tuning of Carl's hearing aid. Russell stops to go to the bathroom and happens upon a giant bird which he lures closer with a chocolate bar. He introduces the colorful creature to Carl and gives it the name Kevin. Kevin follows them as they continue their journey but runs off when they approach the silhouette of a man who calls out to them. However, they see that the man is nothing more than a trick of the eye caused by overlapping stones. They are then approached by a golden retriever with a red light on his collar. Russell tells him to sit and speak and is surprised when the dog answers, using the device on his collar. He tells them his name is Dug (Bob Peterson) and that he is a tracker looking for a bird, at which point Kevin tackles him. The foursome continue their journey, Carl begrudging the additional company. At one point, Kevin loudly calls out and is answered by smaller calls. Dug says that Kevin is calling to her babies and Russell realizes that Kevin is a girl.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the three dogs seen chasing the bird earlier have picked up the scent of Carl and Russell, who they nickname the mailman. The leader Alpha (Bob Peterson), a doberman pinscher, tells Beta (Delroy Lindo), a rottweiler, and Gamma (Jerome Ranft), a bulldog, that they must be vigilant and continue their search. His speaking device appears to be damaged, causing him to talk in a high pitch. Using the device on Gamma's collar, Alpha calls to Dug, who they'd sent on a false mission in order to get rid of him, but finds him in the company of the bird they'd been after. They soon track him down and come upon Carl and Russell, but Kevin has already run off. Instead, they choose to take Carl and Russell to their master. Entering a large gorge, Carl and Russell meet a large pack of dogs, all with high-tech collars on, before meeting their master -- who turns out to be none other than an elderly Charles Muntz.\\n\\nMuntz invites them into The Spirit of Adventure as guests, but his behavior soon turns hostile when he finds out that Russell has adopted a new pet bird. Carl is shocked to see that Muntz has spent all the past years hunting for the bird which he was deemed a fraud for and has gone mad as a result. Muntz reveals a table of head mannequins wearing various headgear and grimly knocks each one off with his cane as he describes the stories their wearers told him; claiming that each one was actually after his bird. Carl and Russell run away from the zeppelin just as Muntz discovers the bird calling out from the roof of Carl's home. Riding on Kevin's back and assisted by Dug, who calls Carl his new master, they barely escape capture by Muntz's dogs, though Kevin is injured in the process. Carl agrees to help Kevin get back to her babies safely but, just before Kevin can re-enter her labyrinth home, a net flies out and captures her. Muntz and his dogs have arrived in the zeppelin, led to the spot by a tracking device on Dug's collar. Muntz throws a lantern beneath Carl's home, setting fire to it. Carl ignores Kevin and runs over to extinguish the flames as Muntz takes Kevin on board and leaves. Angry and disheartened, Carl yells at Dug and tells Russell that he's taking his home to Paradise Falls if it kills him. He manages to set his house down on the Falls, but loses Russell's respect for leaving Kevin.\\n\\nCarl goes inside the house and sits down to look at Ellie's adventure book. Saddened that she never got to see the Falls, he is about to close it when he discovers added pictures near the end, documenting their life together. On the last page is a note written by Ellie that says thanks for the adventure, now go have a new one! Enlightened and inspired, Carl goes outside in time to see Russell take off with a few balloons, using a leaf blower as propulsion. Carl empties his home of extra furniture, allowing it to become airborne once again, and follows Russell. He finds Dug on his porch and happily exclaims that Dug is his dog and he is his master. Russell manages to sneak aboard Muntz's zeppelin but is quickly caught and tied to a chair. Muntz sits him on the ships bomb-bay doors and flips the switch for them to open. Carl flies in and manages to rescue Russell in time, setting him inside the house while he goes into the zeppelin with Dug to fetch Kevin. Hes able to distract the guard dogs with a tennis ball from his walker and frees Kevin but is confronted by Muntz. They engage in a sword fight (albeit Carl uses his extended walker) while Russell, freed of his ties, fights off a squadron of dogs in fighter planes. He regains control of the house and returns to help Carl, who has climbed to the top of the zeppelin with Kevin. Dug has, meanwhile, faced off against Alpha and outsmarted him, effectively becoming the new alpha, and runs off to meet the others topside.\\n\\nKevin, Dug, and Carl run for the house which Russell has landed on the wing of the zeppelin, but Muntz appears with a rifle and shoots at them, causing the house to slip and dangle in the air. Carl struggles to hold onto the house with the hose while Muntz goes in after Kevin. Carl lures Kevin, carrying Dug and Russell, out of the house with chocolate and Muntz attempts to jump out of the window after them. He doesn't make the jump as his foot gets caught in some balloon strings and, weighing too much for the balloons to support him, he falls to his death. As Kevin, Dug, and Russell make it back to the zeppelin, Carl is forced to release his house, which slowly descends into the clouds, a loss which Carl accepts as being for the best.\\n\\nKevin is returned to her three chicks and Carl takes Russell and Dug home where Russell attends his senior explorer ceremony. When Russell's father fails to present him with his final badge, Carl fulfills the role and gives Russell a grape soda badge that Ellie gave him when they first met, calling it the Ellie badge. Afterwards, they sit on a curb together in front of an ice cream shop, Carl acting as a surrogate grandfather to Russell, The Spirit of Adventure anchored above them.\\n\\nAt Paradise Falls, Carl and Ellie's house has landed right at the spot where it was meant to be: on the cliff overlooking the falls.\", 'No Synopsis', '\"Legend tells of a legendary warrior whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend...\" A mysterious panda donning a flowing cape and sedge hat walks through the Chinese landscape. Reputed to be a grand master of kung fu, he enters a tavern where he is immediately attacked by the local ruffians. However, they are no match for his skill and even the legendary kung fu masters, the Furious Five, bow down to the panda\\'s skill, requesting to hang out with him and fight alongside him as...\\n\\n...Po the giant panda (Jack Black) wakes up from his dream in his room. His goose father, Mr. Ping (James Hong) calls to him from the noodle restaurant below to help serve tables. Po admires his Furious Five action figures before going downstairs. An extreme fan of Kung Fu, Po dreams of one day becoming a master worthy of fighting alongside the Five but his girth and clumsiness makes this dream simply a dream and his kung fu talents reside only within his knowledge of moves and artifacts. He is hesitant to express his desires to his dad who is more interested in running his restaurant and advertising his famous \\'secret ingredient soup\\'.\\n\\nMaster Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), a red panda who resides at the Jade Palace temple, practices kung fu in the courtyard with his students, the Furious Five; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Mantis (Seth Rogen), before he is summoned to see tortoise Grand Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). Fearing something is wrong, Shifu rushes to find him meditating in the grand hall. Oogway doesn\\'t deny bad news but calmly tells Shifu he\\'s predicted that the snow leopard warrior Tai Lung (Ian McShane) will escape prison and return to the Valley of Peace to wreak destruction once again. Intent on never letting this happen, Shifu sends his goose messenger, Zeng (Dan Fogler), to fly to Chor-Gom Prison to ensure that security is increased. Oogway then proclaims that it is time to choose the Dragon Warrior; a master of great skill who will be granted the secrets of the universe by reading the Dragon Scroll, kept delicately out of reach on the temple ceiling. Assuming that one of the Furious Five will be chosen, Shifu prepares a competition to determine which one will qualify.\\n\\nFlyers for the competition are spread throughout town and the villagers flock to the temple. Excited to have the opportunity to see his idols in person, Po follows with his noodle cart in tow but struggles on the long staircase to the temple. He is the last to arrive at the gates and finds that they\\'ve shut him out. In a desperate bid to see the competition before it\\'s over, Po fashions fireworks to his cart and blasts himself high into the air, only to come crashing down in the arena just as Oogway is preparing to choose out of the Five. Po opens his eyes to see Oogway\\'s finger pointed right at him and is shocked, along with everyone else, when he is proclaimed to be the Dragon Warrior. Oogway\\'s decision is final, despite Shifu\\'s protests, and Po is carried (unsuccessfully) into the temple leaving Tigress greatly disappointed since it seemed Oogway would have chosen her if Po hadn\\'t arrived.\\n\\nInside the temple, Po examines, with awe, the many weaponry and valuable artifacts before Shifu approaches him and berates him for his obvious lack of skill. He deflates Po\\'s excitement by grabbing his finger in what Po recognizes as the Wuxi Finger Hold, reputed to be extremely powerful. Shifu promises that Po will regret ever being chosen before taking him to the Fives training room where Po is promptly put to the test. Nervous, but excited to try some kung fu moves, Po accepts the challenge but is hurtled, flung, and beaten down to a now-existing Level 0.\\n\\nOn the way to the dormitories, Po overhears the Five poke fun at his incompetence. He has an awkward conversation with Crane, opening up to his own doubts of being the Dragon Warrior. Tigress assures his doubts, calling him a disgrace to kung fu and tells him that, if he is wise, he will leave by morning. Disheartened, Po retreats to a secluded spot. Oogway finds him sitting beneath the Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom with peaches stuffed into his mouth. Sensing his distress, and noting that he finds comfort in food, Oogway tells Po that he worries too much about what was or what could be. He should instead focus on the present moment rather than doubting himself.\\n\\nRenewed with a sense of determination, Po rises the next morning before anyone else and announces that he will stay to train. He spars with each of the Furious Five, receiving swift beatings despite his undeterred enthusiasm. Frustrated by Po\\'s perseverance, Shifu is at a loss. However, the Five become impressed by Po\\'s fortitude and eventually start to warm up to him, with the exception of Tigress. During an acupuncture session with Mantis, the Five reveal that Shifu was not always as stern as he currently is. Tigress explains that Tai Lung himself was the reason for Shifu\\'s shift in personality. Having found him as a newborn on the steps of the temple, Shifu raised Tai Lung as his own and began to hope that he was the fabled Dragon Warrior when the cub displayed a natural talent in kung fu. However, when the time came to stand before Oogway, the grand master sensed darkness in Tai Lung and denied him the honor of receiving the Dragon Scroll. Enraged, Tai Lung went on a rampage through the village and attempted to take the scroll by force. Caring for him too much, Shifu was unable to fight Tai Lung and Oogway was forced to defeat him by blocking his chi. Tigress then says that Shifu never cared for anything or anyone since, not even her; his own foster daughter.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Zeng arrives at Chor-Gom Prison and is escorted to Tai Lung\\'s hold by the over-confident Commander Vachir (Michael Clarke Duncan), a rhinoceros. Vachir assures Zeng that the prison is inescapable as one of Zeng\\'s feathers falls within reach of Tai Lung. Using his tail, he uses the feather to remove the chi-blockers in the turtle-shell contraption on his back and break free. Tai Lung escapes the prison in an explosive display of his fierce kung fu abilities and grabs Zeng, instructing him to fly back to Shifu to announce that the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.\\n\\nBack at the temple, Po entertains the Five with some noodle soup he prepared, imitating Shifu using a noodle as a mustache. Outside, Shifu is met by a disheveled Zeng who relays the news. Panicked, Shifu finds Oogway beside the Sacred Peach Tree and tells him that Tai Lung is on his way. Oogway is shocked, but assures Shifu that, if he finds faith in the panda and trains him, Tai Lung will be defeated and Shifu will finally find inner peace. He then gives Shifu his wooden staff and claims that his time has come. He walks near the edge of the cliff side and vanishes in a haze of peach blossoms. Shifu returns to the temple, disconsolate, and informs the Five of Oogway\\'s passing and how Po is their last chance to defeat Tai Lung. Horrified, Po flees from the temple but is soon stopped by Shifu. Po confronts Shifu, saying that he tried to kick him out of the temple. When Shifu asks Po why he then stayed knowing that his teacher wanted him to quit, Po confesses a deep self-loathing as a fat failure how he held out a faint hope that Shifu could change him. As Shifu realizes how spiritually burdened the giant panda is, Po asks how he will train him to become the Dragon Warrior. Facing such an challenge with a student so encumbered in multiple respects, Shifu admits that he doesn\\'t know.\\n\\nOverhearing this from the temple roof, Tigress leaves the Jade Palace and runs out to the countryside, soon followed by the rest of the Five, to meet Tai Lung head on. They find him crossing the Thread of Hope, a series of bridges through the mountains. They attempt to stop him on the last bridge. After an epic battle, the Five gain the upper hand and appear to have defeated Tai Lung, tying him to the remains of the severed bridge and sending him into the mist below. However, Tai Lung\\'s skills prove superior, and he surprises them by flinging himself onto the cliff and overpowering them with a chi block.\\n\\nRising that morning, Shifu finds Po in the temple kitchen, surrounded by cabinets with perfect hole punches in the doors and boards broken clean in two. Shifu entertains an idea and tells Po where Monkey keeps his cookies before hiding behind the doorway. He reenters and sees Po performing a perfect split near the ceiling, chowing down on the cookies. Realizing Po\\'s latent talent, Shifu takes him high into the Wu Dan Mountains to the Pool of Sacred Tears where Oogway founded the origins of kung fu. With a dramatic flourish, Shifu proclaims to be Po\\'s master, with full faith in his student at last. With that emotional support, Shifu begins his rigorous training Po, using food as a reward. Po\\'s unique training proves to be successful and he grows stronger and more coordinated while Shifu\\'s own spirits rises and advances at Po\\'s rapid improvement. Shifu\\'s faith in Po is vindicated in an increasingly energetic duel over a dumpling that becomes a wild spar in which the Giant Panda fights with powerful and innovative skill to win. However, it is when Po throws back the dumpling he won that Shifu has truly advanced, with a newfound emotional strength and serenity.\\n\\nThey return to the temple as Crane flies in, carrying the rest of the Five, who have been paralyzed by Tai Lung\\'s attacks. Shifu rejuvenates them but Po is discouraged by the fact that five masters could not overpower Tai Lung; how could he? Shifu assures him that he will have what no one else has; the Dragon Scroll. Shifu retrieves it for Po and instructs him to read it, but Po exclaims in surprise to find nothing but a blank, reflective glaze on the scroll. Terribly disappointed, Shifu relents to have the Five evacuate the village while he remains at the temple to hold Tai Lung off. The Five reluctantly agree and Po returns to his father who is packing up the noodle shop. Ping tries to console Po, but Po admits that hes not sure of who he is and can\\'t believe he\\'s Ping\\'s son. Taken aback, Ping whispers to Po something he should have told him long ago; the secret ingredient to his famous secret ingredient soup. The secret is... nothing. He explains that something becomes special if people truly believe that it is. Po opens the scroll to see his reflection on its glazed surface and realizes the secret before turning back to the temple.\\n\\nShifu waits at the top of the steps until Tai Lung arrives. Refusing to give his old student the scroll, Shifu battles Tai Lung. Tai Lung demands his birthright to have the scroll and blames Shifu for planting dreams in his head of what he thought was his destiny and not standing up to Oogway when the turtle disagreed. Shifu, while fending off his adoptive sons\\' attacks, justifies that he is obeying his master\\'s judgment and it was Oogway\\'s decision to make alone. However, when Tai Lung see Master Oogway\\'s memorial, the snow leopard sneeringly counters that Shifu has obviously replaced the late Master and thus the red panda now has the authority to arbitrarily overrule Oogway\\'s decision. Infuriated at the idea of disrespecting his teacher\\'s legacy like that, Shifu goes on the attack.\\n\\nIn the battlle, Tai Lung wails, with a subtle undertone of grief and abandonment, at Shifu to tell him how proud he is and Shifu admits that he was proud from the first moment, but it was his pride that blinded him from seeing what Tai Lung was becoming. Tai Lung is momentarily moved by this confession, but his vindictive ambition spitefully reasserts. Denying any interest in apologies or any reconciliation with his foster father, Tai Lung demands only the scroll. He is stopped from dealing a deadly blow to Shifu by Po, who appears, exhausted, at the doorway of the temple. Baffled by the Dragon Warrior\\'s pudgy exterior, Tai Lung nonetheless attacks Po when he reveals the Dragon Scroll in hand. Their battle takes them into the village, each one vying for possession of the scroll. At one point, Po imagines the scroll as a bowl of dumplings to encourage him to climb a high precipice to get it, but Tai Lung is convinced that the scroll is giving him power.\\n\\nAfter a protracted battle, Tai Lung finally wins the scroll and triumphantly opens it for the supposed power within. However, upon seeing the golden reflection within, he completely fails to understand its symbolic meaning. When Po rises to explain it, Tai Lung refuses to accept the panda\\'s words or the fact that everything the snow leopard has betrayed and sacrificed in his eyes has been for apparently nothing.\\n\\nNow consumed with such enraged despair, Tai Lung attacks Po again, but without discipline or real purpose behind it. Using ingenuity and his rebounding stomach, Po manages to render Tai Lung helpless. Tai Lung spews out a slur of insults before Po takes his finger in the Wuxi Finger Hold. Tai Lung calls Pos bluff and Po admits that Shifu never taught him the move - he figured it out on his own. With a triumphant \"Skadoosh!\", Po flexes his pinky, resulting in a magnificent wave of raw energy that resonates throughout the valley and is felt by the Five leading the refugees into the hills. Having presumably killed Tai Lung, Po is cheered on by the returning villagers. Tigress and the rest of the Five bow down to Po, calling him master, before Po runs back to the temple to check on Shifu. He finds Shifu lying still, but alive, on the floor of the temple and tells him he defeated Tai Lung. Shifu thanks him and tells Po that he\\'s brought him peace before closing his eyes. Po calls out to him and Shifu reprimands him, saying that he\\'s merely resting. Po lies down beside him and, after a quiet, meditative moment, asks if he wants to get something to eat. Shifu says, Ok.\\n\\nThey enjoy a meal of dumplings together at the Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom, overlooking a new day while a seed that Shifu had previously planted begins to bloom.', \"In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, Imelda Rivera was the wife of a musician who left her and their 3-year-old daughter Coco, to pursue a career in music. She banned music in the family and opened a shoe-making family business. Ninety-six years later, her great-great-grandson, 12-year-old Miguel, now lives with Coco and their family. He secretly dreams of becoming a musician like Ernesto de la Cruz, a popular actor and singer of Coco's generation. One day, Miguel inadvertently damages the photo of Coco with her parents at the center of the family ofrenda and removes it, discovering that her father (whose face is torn out) was holding Ernesto's famous guitar.\\n\\nConcluding that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather, Miguel ignores his grandmother Elena's objections and leaves to enter a talent show for the Day of the Dead. He enters Ernesto's mausoleum and steals his guitar to use in the show, but becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can see and be seen by his Xoloitzcuintli dog Dante and his skeletal dead relatives who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him there, they realize that Imelda cannot visit as Miguel removed her photo from the ofrenda. Discovering that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, Miguel must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise or he will become one of the dead: to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family using an Aztec marigold petal that can undo the curse placed upon him by stealing Ernesto's guitar. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing but on the condition that he abandon his musical pursuits when he returns to the Land of the Living; Miguel refuses and attempts to seek Ernesto's blessing.\\n\\nMiguel encounters Héctor, a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once played with Ernesto and offers to help Miguel reach him. In return, Héctor asks Miguel to take his photo back to the Land of the Living so he can visit his daughter before she forgets him and he disappears completely. Héctor attempts to return Miguel to his relatives, but Miguel escapes and infiltrates Ernesto's mansion, learning along the way that an old friendship between the two deteriorated before Héctor's death. Ernesto welcomes Miguel as his descendant, but Héctor confronts them, imploring Miguel to take his photo. Miguel soon realizes that Ernesto murdered Héctor using a poisoned drink and stole the songs he had written, passing them off as his own to become famous. To maintain his legacy, Ernesto steals the photo and has Miguel and Héctor thrown into a cenote pit.\\n\\nMiguel realizes that Héctor is his actual great-great-grandfather and that Coco is Héctor's daughter, the only living person who still remembers him. With the help of Dante - who turns into an alebrije - the dead Riveras find and rescue them. Miguel reveals that Héctor's decision to return home to her and Coco resulted in his death, and Imelda and Héctor reconcile. They infiltrate Ernesto's sunrise concert to retrieve Héctor's photo from Ernesto and expose his crimes. Ernesto is crushed by a falling church bell as in his previous life, but the photo falls into the water and disappears.\\n\\nAs the sun rises, Héctor is in danger of being forgotten by Coco and disappearing. Imelda blesses Miguel with no conditions attached so he can return to the Land of the Living, where he plays a song for Coco that Héctor wrote for her during her childhood. The song sparks her memory of Héctor and revitalizes her, and she gives Miguel the torn-out piece of the photo from the ofrenda, which shows Héctor's face. Elena reconciles with Miguel, accepting both him and music back into the family.\\n\\nOne year later, Miguel proudly presents the family ofrenda - featuring a photo of the now deceased Coco and the restored photo of Héctor and Imelda - to his new baby sister. Letters kept by Coco contain evidence that Ernesto stole Héctor's songs. As a result, Ernesto's legacy is destroyed and the community honors Héctor instead. In the Land of the Dead, Héctor and Imelda join Coco for a visit to the living Riveras as Miguel sings and plays for his dead and living relatives.\", \"Based on both the legend of Hercules and Heracles.\\n\\nOn Mt Olympus, Zeus and his wife are celebrating the birth of their son, Hercules. The Lord of the Underworld, Hades, is also invited, though is not at all pleased with the birth of Hercules.\\n\\nReturning to the Underworld, Hades meets up with the 3 Fates, who tell Hades that in 18 years, when the planets align, if he unleashes the Titans (who were imprisoned by Zeus), he will defeat Zeus and rule over all. However, there is a possibility that Hercules could stop him.\\n\\nHades assigns his minions, Pain and Panic, to turn Hercules mortal, and kill him. Armed with a potion, the two kidnap Hercules, and take him to Earth. Hercules drinks almost every drop except one, when a childless couple disturbs the two minions' plan. The two decide to tell Hades that they killed Hercules, but figure leaving him on Earth as a mortal will keep him from interfering in Hades' eventual plot.\\n\\nAs Hercules is almost completely mortal, he cannot return to Mt Olympus. However, the childless couple have taken him in, and raise him as their own. However, not being completely mortal, Hercules is ostracized from the rest of society by his immense strength. As he approaches his teenage years, his father tells of how they found him, with a medallion bearing the symbol of the gods.\\n\\nHercules sets off for the Temple of Zeus to find answers. Once inside the temple, the enormous statue of Zeus comes to life, first scaring Hercules, but then explaining how he is the young boy's father. Zeus then explains that if Hercules can become a True Hero, he'll be able to return to Mt Olympus and rejoin them. Zeus then provides Hercules with a winged horse named Pegasus, and sends them off to find Philoctetes.\\n\\nHercules and Pegasus find Philoctetes (who is nicknamed 'Phil') on a deserted island. Having become a grouchy, old satyr, Phil is at first reluctant, but finally relents. After an intense period of training, Hercules grows from a scrawny teenager to a buff young man. At Hercules' insistence to try what he has learned, Phil, Hercules and Pegasus head for the city of Thebes, which is plagued by a number of disasters and problems.\\n\\nOn the way there, they are sidetracked by Meg, who appears to be menaced by a centaur. Hercules grows somewhat enchanted with her, before Phil gets them back on track to Thebes. After they leave, Meg meets with Hades, and his assistants, Pain and Panic. Meg was actually trying to get the centaur to side with Hades, but claims Hercules spoiled her plans. Upon hearing this, Hades angrily grabs his assistants, realizing they have lied to him. Pain and Panic manage to convince Hades that since Hercules is mortal, they can still kill him.\\n\\nIn Thebes, Hercules tries to convince the citizens that he is a hero, but no one is willing to believe him. Suddenly, Meg appears, and tells of two small boys trapped under a rock in a nearby canyon. Hercules saves the little boys (actually Pain and Panic in disguise), but then has to contend with the 3-headed beast called the Hydra. After finding out that cutting off one head produces 3 more, Hercules ends up crushing the beast with a rock slide. The defeat of the Hydra causes the citizens of Thebes to acknowledge Hercules as a hero, and further anger Hades.\\n\\nHades continues to send beasts and creature against Hercules, but each and everyone is defeated, further making Hercules a hero in the eyes of the citizens. Statues and merchandise are soon rampant with Hercules' face, and Hercules thinks that his fame will allow him to return to Mt Olympus. However, upon visiting the Temple of Zeus again, Zeus explains to Hercules that fame does not equal heroism. When Hercules asks to know what he can do, Zeus refuses to explain further.\\n\\nBack in Thebes, the conversation has upset Hercules, who wonders if he even has what it takes to be a hero. While in his home, Meg appears, and gets Hercules to come with her for an evening rendezvous. However, Meg's intentions are to secretly find Hercules' weakness, but as the night goes on, she begins to find him charming. The mood is broken when Phil and Pegasus show up to take Hercules home. During the flight away, Phil ends up getting hit by a tree, and falls off Pegasus. When he comes to, he sees Meg talking to Hades, with their conversation sounding as if Meg has been two-timing Hercules. In truth, Meg refuses to go along with Hades plan, claiming that Hercules has no weakness...which leads Hades to believe that she IS that weakness.\\n\\nBack at Thebes Stadium, Phil tries to convince Hercules of what he saw, but Hercules angrily hits Phil. Phil, hurt by his protege's backlash, gets up and leaves. Once Phil is gone, Hades appears, and offers Hercules an ultimatum: if Hercules gives up his powers for 24 hours, Hades will allow Meg to go free, with the provision that the deal will be voided if any harm comes to her. Hercules goes through with the deal, only to have Hades then tell Hercules how Meg was working for him. Now drained of his strength, Hercules can only watch as Hades lets loose the Titans that Zeus had imprisoned years earlier.\\n\\nHades sends a giant cyclops to Thebes to destroy the City. Even though Hercules is drained of his strength, he still tries to stop the creature. Fearing that he'll be killed, Meg and Pegasus find Phil, who they convince to return and help his student. With Phil's help and some ingenuity, Hercules ends up blinding and finishing off the cyclops, but in the process, Meg is gravely injured.\\n\\nHer injury causes Hades' deal to expire, and Hercules receives his strength back. With Phil watching over Meg, Hercules and Pegasus fly to Mt Olympus, where the Titans have all but over-powered Zeus and the other gods. Hercules helps turn the tide of battle, and ends up taking care of the Titans, and Hades angrily retreats to the Underworld.\\n\\nWhen Hercules returns to Thebes, Phil reveals that Meg has died. Upset by this, Hercues descends into the Underworld to get her back. Hercules makes a deal with Hades, that he will take Meg's place if he rescues her from the River of Death. Hades accepts the deal, sure that Hercules will die before he can save her.\\n\\nIt seems Hercules will die, but upon reaching Meg, he suddenly begins to glow yellow, having achieved god status by risking his life to save her. Hercules manages to get Meg out of the River of Death, much to Hades ranting and protestations, several of which cause Hercules to send him flying into the river, where the dead attempt to drown him.\\n\\nHercules, Pegasus, Phil and Meg then fly to Mt Olympus where the gods are waiting to welcome Hercules back, now that he has become a 'True Hero.' However, Hercules chooses to stay on Earth, but still be able to visit his family.\\n\\nThe film ends as one of the gods creates a constellation in the sky of Hercules, making Phil swell with pride that he was able to train a legend and a god.\", '&#12302;&#21531;&#12398;&#21517;&#12399;&#12290;&#12303;\\n\\nThe film opens to a wave of comets, shooting across the sky.\\n\\nTwo teenagers, Taki Tachibana and Mitsuha Miyamizu begin to speak, almost simultaneously. They speak of time and of dreams, and how each can be a great loss.\\n\\nA piece of one comet breaks off and plummets to the earth\\n\\nWe see Mitsuha struggle in her sleep. She calls out to Taki, asking him if he remembers.\\n\\nMitsuha wakes up. But it is not her really. It is Taki, who is freaked out to be in a girls body (though not above copping a feel on Mitsuha\\'s breasts). Mitsuhas younger sister Yotsuha comes into her room, noticing her being weird again and tells her breakfast is ready. Taki, as Mitsuha, disrobes and looks in the mirror, freaked out by the strange dream he keeps having; waking up as a girl.\\n\\nGoing downstairs, apparently back to her normal self, Mitsuha eats with, Hitoha, who is their grandmother and guardian. Hitoha and Yotsuha note that Mitsuha had been acting weird the day before. They watch a broadcast that notes that a comet not seen for over a thousand years will be able to be seen in the sky in a months time.\\n\\nMitsuha walks to school and meets up with her friends Katsuhiko and Sayaka. As they walk, they see a campaign speech by the local mayor, who is up for reelection. As she walks by, the man screams at Mitsuha to stand up straight. We realize that the mayor is actually Mitsuhas father, estranged from the rest of the family for unknown reasons.\\n\\nAt school, Mitsuha flips through a notebook, and finds a note. It reads, \"Who Are You?\"\\n\\nLater, Mitsuha learns that the day before she had forgotten her classroom and where her locker was. This information shocks and surprises her. Sayaka chalks it up to stress Mitsuha is under to perform a Miko ritual for the family shrine, something Mitsuha doesn\\'t want to be reminded of. As the three walk home, they bemoan how small their town of Itomori is; there are no restaurants, bookstores, or social scene. Mitsuha herself dreams of graduating school so she can move to Tokyo.\\n\\nKatsuhiko suggests they go to a café. The girls scream out excited. In actuality, it is just a vending machine nearby a park bench. Mitsuha goes home, leaving Sayaka with Katsuhiko. Sayaka asks him about his future plans. Katsuhiko says he will most likely just stay in town like he always has after graduation.\\n\\nMitsuha, Yotsuha, and Hitoha practice the art of Kumihimo (braid making). Hitoha tells them the importance of what they are creating.\\n\\nThe mayor meets with Katsuhiko\\'s father, who is part of the local construction union, in order to get the support of his men for the upcoming election. Katsuhiko is told by his father that he will work with them the following weekend to his annoyance.\\n\\nThe next night, Mitsuha and Yotsuha perform the ritual for their shrine with includes ritualized dancing and the creation of Kuchikamizake; a sake in which someone chews rice into a paste and spits it back into a bowl, allowing it to ferment into alcohol. A few of Mitsuhas classmates walk by the ritual and mock her, to her annoyance.\\n\\nAs they walk home Yotsuha tells her big sister not to take it so personally, but Mitsuha is losing patience with her life. \"I hate this town!\" she screams out. \"I hate this life! Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!\"\\n\\nThe next day, Mitsuha wakes up but not as herself. She is in Taki\\'s body. She is quite disturbed to be a boy and all that entails physically. Finding out she has overslept, she quickly gets dressed and heads out, suddenly struck that she is finally walking around Tokyo. Mitsuha (as Taki) arrives to school hours late and is accosted by his friends Shinta and Tsukasa, who note that Taki has been acting weird as well. They suggest going to a café, and Mitsuha readily agrees as there are none where she lives. Getting a call on Taki\\'s phone, she realizes Taki has a job at a restaurant and she is going to be late.\\n\\nMitsuha goes to work but being Taki is harder than it looks. She is unprepared to work in a restaurant, making mistakes all night. It finally comes to a head, when a man tries to con the place for free food. Mitsuha is overwhelmed and when the man wants to pick a fight, Taki\\'s older co-worker Ms. Okudera comes over and handles the situation, though the man cuts her skirt with a box cutter out of spite.\\n\\nLater, Okudera tells Taki that she followed the handbook to handle the situation though she wished she could have done something more severe to the man who was clearly conning the restaurant. Noticing the cut in Ms. Okuderas skirt, Mitsuha offers to fix it. Ms. Okudera is charmed by this, saying Takis has been changing lately, and she is charmed that he now has a feminine side.\\n\\nThe next day, Taki is back to normal and knows nothing of the previous day. The staff he works with wants to know more details with his relationship with Ms. Okudera, but he has no idea what they are talking about. Ms. Okudera comes in and tells them all to have a good day, winking at Taki, which makes him blush.\\n\\nBy this point, Taki and Mitsuha realize their body switching dreams are actually happening, and take steps to help out each other if they switch bodies. Writing notes to each other on their smart phones, and in notebooks, they each set ground rules so they don\\'t step on each others toes. Mitsuhas rules are more concerned with etiquette, not having him taking showers as her (so hell see her naked) and other social cues. Taki gives her tips on his job and tells her not to blow all his hard earned money on sweets, which only makes him have to take more shifts at the restaurant.\\n\\nDespite trying to play nice, both cant help but have a little fun at the others expense. Taki makes a few people fall in love with Mitsuha at school while Mitsuha flirts with Ms. Okudera, giving Taki a real shot with her. Both of them are livid with the others meddling, both noting that, I dont want a relationship!\\n\\nOne day, Taki switches with Mitsuha on a weekend day. It turns out to be the day Mitsuha, Hitoha, and Yotsuha are traveling to the family shrine far into the forest. While they walk, Hitoha talks to them about the idea of a union; whether it is a braid they created, time itself, or even taking a drink, unions are made every day.\\n\\nThe three make it to the shrine and make an offering of the sake they made during the ritual.\\n\\nTaki wakes up. Checking his phone, he notices a text from Ms. Okudera, saying she cant wait to meet him. Confused, he checks the notes in his phone, and realized that Mitsuha had set him up on a date with Ms. Okudera.15 minutes from then. Taki quickly gets dressed and races out of his house, racing to meet her.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Mitsuha gets ready for her day, using her braid to tie up her hair. She realizes Taki and Ms. Okudera are most likely on their date at that moment. She looks into the mirror and sees that she is crying. She is surprised at first but then realizes the truth; she wanted to have that date with Taki herself. Try as she may, she is beginning to fall for a boy she has never met.\\n\\nTaki meets up with Ms. Okudera and go to a nice, if expensive restaurant. Though they both share a mutual crush, Taki is nervous and unsure how to act. His mind is somewhere else. At one point, they look at a photo display, and Taki is taken by a group of shots that remind him of Mitsuhas town. Ms. Okudera comes up to him and pointedly states she became more attracted to him once he starting acting odd, but he has changed again. He has become someone else. Later, Taki tries to extend the date but Ms. Okudera declines. She notes that is clear that Taki has a crush on someone else; that is why he is acting so different.\\n\\nTaki, making a decision, tries to call Mitsuha.\\n\\nBack in Itomori, Mitsuha cuts her hair. She goes to the local town festival with her friends. The comet finally becomes visible, and in a field, Mitsuha stares in awe. She sees a part of the comet break off and fall. Her eyes widen\\n\\nBack in Tokyo, Taki is sad when the call cannot be connected. He wishes they could switch again, but after that night, it never happened again.\\n\\nDays pass, and Taki goes through the motions. He begins to sketch Itomori from memory, trying desperately to figure out where she lives, with little luck. One day, he decides to leave the city to find the town and finally meet Mitsuha. Tagging along are Ms. Okudera and Tsukasa, who are there for moral support. They are curious and charmed by Takis mystery girl, while Taki must be coy about how he met her.\\n\\nThe trio travel many places but no one knows the town Taki has drawn. About to give up, Taki and his friends stop at a local restaurant. The owner recognizes the place as Itomori, but when Taki asks how far away it is, the owner goes silent for a moment before explaining three years before the town was destroyed by a comet fragment, killing over 500 people.\\n\\nTaki is taken to the outskirts of Itomori where he sees little left of the town. He tries to show his friends the notes Mitsuha left for him on his phone, only for them to disappear. He doesnt know what to think.\\n\\nThe trio goes to a local library and sees the reports about the tragedy and the list of the dead. Mitsuha, her sister, and her friends are among the dead. Taki is shocked and heartbroken; he is somehow linked to a dead girl, who died three years ago.\\n\\nThe three get a hotel room for the night. Tsukasa asks Ms. Okuderas opinion on Takis recent behavior and what he claims about Mitsuha. Ms. Okudera, while admitting it is all strange, notes she always found Taki to be nice, but he became even a better person because of this girl.\\n\\nLater that night, Ms. Okudera and Taki talk. She notices a braid on Takis wrist. Taki says he got a few years ago, but he doesn\\'t remember who gave it to him or why, though he wears it often for good luck.\\n\\nAs he sleeps, Mitsuha calls out to him to remember.\\n\\nThe next morning, Ms. Okudera wakes up to find a note from Taki to tell them to go home without him. He has to go somewhere first.\\n\\nTaki travels to Itomori, and finds his way to the shrine of Mitsuhas family, still intact. He travels inside and finds the sake Mitsuha and her sister left. Taki thinks if he drinks some of her sake, he can make one last connection and perhaps save her.\\n\\nTaki drinks some, but as he stands up, he trips and falls. As he does, he takes a journey, and sees all of Mitsuha\\'s life; her birth, happiness with her parents, the birth of her sister, the illness and death of her mother, her fathers abandonment of the family and his duties, her grandmother caring for them, and her death by the comet.\\n\\nTaki wakes up in Mitsuha\\'s body. He realizes he has one last chance. Seeing the television, he realizes it is the day of the comet, and the towns destruction. Trying to talk to Hitoha, Hitoha realizes that someone else inhabits her granddaughter, as she had a similar phenomenon happen to her when she was younger. Taki wonders if Mitsuhas family line had these connections. Taki (as Mitsuha) tells Hitoha about the comet but is told no one will believe them.\\n\\nUndeterred, Taki finds Mitsuha\\'s friends Katsuhiko and Sayaka and tell them what will happen. Despite doubting what they have been told, they believe her enough to help. They make a plan to knock out the towns power with explosives taken from Katsuhiko\\'s father\\'s construction company. Sayaka then will get on the emergency broadcast station and tell everyone to evacuate to the school, well out of the blast radius of the comet. However, they will need to convince the mayor, Mitsuhas father, of the severity.\\n\\nTaki goes to Mitsuha\\'s father, but all the man can see is that his daughter has gone insane and orders her to see a doctor. Enraged, Taki grabs him by the tie and screams, You son of a---but they both stop. Who are you? Mitsuhas father asks, also seeing that his daughter is not standing before him. Nevertheless, the warning falls on deaf ears. Taki, thinking his body with Mitsuha inside is near the Shrine, races up there to meet her.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Mitsuha wakes up in Taki\\'s body in the present day and sees the town destroyed. Does that mean I died? she asks.\\n\\nMitsuha remembers the day she went to Tokyo, hoping to meet Taki, thinking that even though they were technically strangers, if they were to meet, they would know their connection. By chance she met him on the train, though he did not recognize her (as their connection would only begin 3 years after her death). Heartbroken, she leaves the train, but Taki senses something and calls out to her. She takes out her braid and flings it to him, asking him to remember her name. She was the one who gave him the braid and thus linked them together.\\n\\nTaki and Mitsuha finally are at the shrine, but cannot see each other, being separated by time itself. However, during the Magic Hour in a certain spot, they can finally see each other, and meet for the first time. Taki returns her braid and she ties up her hair. Taki suggests they write each other names on their hands so they wont forget. Taki writes his, but when she goes to write her name, the connection is broken.\\n\\nTaki wakes up, back in his body, on the outskirts of the still destroyed Itomori. He cannot remember why he came there, or the name of a girl that haunts him. He heads home to Tokyo.\\n\\nBack in the past, Mitsuha, knowing what will happen enacts her plan with her friends. They blow up the power grid with explosives, switching on emergency power. Sayaka then tells the entire town of forest fires in an effort to get people to the school. Though some take heed of the warning, not enough people do. Plus, the Mayor is trying to figure out who is sending out this false warning. Eventually, Sayaka is caught and the warning is turned off. Katsuhiko tells Mitsuha that unless she is able to convince her father, everything is lost.\\n\\nMitsuha begins to run, but becomes increasingly despondent as she cannot remember Takis name. She trips and falls, looking at her hand. She sees that Taki, instead of writing his name, wrote I LOVE YOU instead. Shocked and in tears, she continues to run, before reuniting with her father in a building.\\n\\nThe comet fragment still hits the town, destroying it.\\n\\n5 years later...\\n\\nTaki has graduated from high school and college, and is now trying to enter the work force as an architect. However, his passionate and idealistic views on preserving cities in case of disasters make him look foolish to interviewers, which lead him to get few if any offers.\\n\\nTaki gets a call from Ms. Okudera, asking to meet up. They catch up, and she mentions they day they went to Itomori. Taki says he doesnt remember much of that day or why he was momentarily obsessed with the town. It turns out that reality has changed. Mitsuha was able to convince her father of the danger. That on top of her daring plan, led to the entire town to be evacuated to an area outside of the blast radius. The town was decimated, yet no one died. Still, Taki has no idea of his connection to averting a tragedy or the girl he help save.\\n\\nAs they part, Ms. Okudera tells Taki that she hopes he one day finds happiness. Taki notes the same, though it has felt as if he has spent years searching for it, yearning for something, or rather someone.\\n\\nIn a diner, he hears a couple bicker over wedding plans. We see it is Sayaka and Katsuhiko, who survived thanks to Taki and Mitsuha. Taki feels a momentary feeling of connection, but brushes it off as nothing.\\n\\nTaki, not knowing why fully, searches the streets every day for a woman whose hair is tied up with a specific braid.\\n\\nAt one point, Taki and Mitsuha cross paths in the street, but dont look back, deciding their weird feelings are nothing.\\n\\nOne day, finally, they see each other on different subways. Though they are not sure why, they feel a connection. After getting off, they scramble around the city, searching for each other. Taki sees a woman at the top of a staircase and passes her by, as she walks down. Once again, they feel a stirring and almost ignore it once more. However, Taki cannot take it anymore and calls out to the woman. It is Mitsuha. He asks if they have met before. Mitsuha looks at him with tears in her eyes. She says that she feels the same way. Simultaneously, they ask, \"Can I ask you your name?\"\\n\\nWe are left to infer they will recover their memories and finally be together, in love.', 'In New Orleans, a young girl named Tiana ( Elizabeth M. Dampier) and her mother are visiting the La Bouff family, where Tiana\\'s mother Eudora (Oprah Winfrey) is crafting a dress for the family\\'s daughter, Charlotte (Breanna Brooks). Charlotte is a lover of fairy tales, and Eudora reads the two the story of \"The Frog Prince.\" While Charlotte is enamoured with kissing a frog that becomes a prince, Tiana finds the thought disgusting.\\n\\nUpon returning home, Tiana helps her father, James (Terrence Howard) prepare gumbo. As the meal is finished, her father tells of his dream to one day open his own restaurant. When Tiana eagerly chimes in that she wants to help, her father claims they\\'ll call it Tiana\\'s Place. Upon seeing the Evening Star outside her window, Tiana makes a wish, to which her father explains that wishing can only go so far, and that she has to help that wish along.\\n\\nAs time passes, Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) holds onto the dream, even after her father has passed away. Working two different jobs, Tiana spends almost all of her time working and saving for a place, with little time for friends or fun. One morning, she runs into Charlotte (Jennifer Cody) and her father \\'Big Daddy\\' La Bouff (John Goodman), who has been named King of the Mardi Gras for the fifth year in a row. Charlotte is incredibly excited that a visiting prince named Naveen (Bruno Campos) is in New Orleans. As Naveen is single, Charlotte hopes to fulfill her wish of marrying a prince and living happily ever after, and has invited him to attend a social function at the family mansion.\\n\\nKnowing of Tiana\\'s cooking skills, Charlotte pays her friend a large sum of money to cater the event. Tiana is pleased, as the money is just enough to allow her to purchase the place to start her restaurant. Tiana contacts the building\\'s owners and shows the place to her mother. While Eudora is pleased, she is worried that Tiana seems to have no time for herself, with her one-mindedness regarding the restaurant.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Prince Naveen is entertaining a crowd; playing the ukelele with a band, and dancing. His assistant Lawrence (Peter Bartlett) angrily comes up to him, complaining that the two would be late for the La Bouff\\'s masquerade. Naveen brushes the issue off, and offers to buy everyone in the crowd a drink, but Lawrence reveals that the prince is broke. His only options of fixing his financial state are to marry a wealthy young lady, or get a job. Relucantly, Naveen agrees, but a spectactle soon ensues, resulting in the two landing dizzily on the footpath. A tall man, introducing himself as Dr. Facilier (Keith David) greets them, and hands Naveen a business card reading \\'Tarot Readings, Charms, Potions, Dreams Made Real\\', before pretending to read the prince\\'s palm and recognising him as a royal. Naveen eagerly informs Lawrence of Facilier\\'s feat, but the assistant grabs a newspaper with the prince\\'s face printed on it, from the witch doctor\\'s back pocket and calls him a charlatan. Facilier has a brief flash of anger, before he regains his composure and invites the others into his shop. Naveen and Lawrence each take three of his tarot cards. Facilier looks at Naveen\\'s cards, and deduces that he is from across the sea, and despite being royalty has little money, due to his parents cutting off his funds. He says the prince needs to marry a rich young woman, but this would conflict with his urges to be free. Lastly, the Shadow Man states that although freedom takes money, he sees the prince being wealthy in his future. He then moves onto Lawrence, and after inspecting the assistant\\'s cards, concludes that although he has been pushed around by others all his life, he will be the man he always wanted to be; namely, Lawrence being wealthy, powerful and the boss of Naveen. Facilier offers both men his hand, and while Naveen uncertainly shakes it, Lawrence does so with fervour. Quickly, the witch doctor gets down to work, pricking the prince\\'s finger and filling up a small head-shaped talisman with his blood. Transformations begin to change both Naveen and Lawrence, but the scene darkens before anything noticeable occurs.\\n\\nAt the La Bouff mansion, Tiana shows up to cater the event, and soon, Prince Naveen arrives. Charlotte eagerly goes to him for a dance. As Tiana watches her friend, she discovers the realtors of the property have also attended the function, as they approach her and the food. Tiana eagerly tells of her wish to sign the papers to the building as .soon as possible, but the two men explain that someone else has offered a larger sum, and are planning to deny her the property, unless she can come up with more money. Upset and heartbroken, Tiana accidentally makes a mess of her outfit. Charlotte, seeing her friend in need, allows her to change out of the outfit, into a blue gown with tiara. While in Charlotte\\'s room, she sees the star shining in the sky, and wishes for help regarding her restaurant. As she looks down, she finds a frog sitting near her, and sarcastically asks it if it wants a kiss. To her surprise, the frog replies, and Tiana screams and races back inside. After unsuccessfully dodging the stuffed animals thrown at him and being smacked with a book, the frog is finally able to tell Tia, that he is Prince Naveen of Maldonia. She then asks him, that if he is Prince Naveen, who is the person dancing with Charlotte downstairs, to which he replies that he has no idea. Suddenly, he spots the name of the book Tiana is holding; The Frog Prince. He, under the impression that Tia is a princess, tells her that like what happens in the book, if she kisses him, he will turn back into a prince. She abruptly refuses, but when Naveen mentions that his wealthy family might be able to reward her in some way, Tiana thinks about her restaurant, and determindedly plants a kiss on the frog.\\n\\nTo the horror of both parties, not only is Naveen still a frog, but Tia has changed into one two. Shocked and angry, she launches herself at the prince and tackles him, until they both go flying out the window onto a drum set, before falling into the neck of Charlotte\\'s dress. \\'Big Daddy\\' La Bouff yells for Stella the dog to catch the frogs, who run across a dinner table before escaping via a bunch of balloons.\\n\\nAs the masquerade comes to an abrupt end, the Prince Naveen imposter hurries into a nearby cottage and opens up a cabinet to find an empty jar. Dr. Facilier appears from behind him and accuses him of letting the real prince/frog go. The imposter is revealed to be Lawrence, who can only keep the prince\\'s form if he is wearing the blood-filled talisman around his neck. Lawrence, having second thoughts about the deceit, throws the talisman to Facilier, telling him to wear it instead. The Shadow Man angrily shouts for him to be careful with the object, and then replies that even if he wanted to be the fake prince, the voodoo magic wouldn\\'t work on him. They also discuss their plan; Lawrence is going to marry Charlotte, then Facilier would dispose of Big Daddy, and their fortune would be shared.\\n\\nStill clutching onto the balloon strings, Tiana discovers that the reason why Naveen was changed into a frog was because he was messing with voodoo, and stubbornly states that the only way to get things in life is through hard work. Taken aback, Naveen questions why a princess would ever have to work, and Tia replies that she\\'s a waitress not a princess. Outraged, the prince exclaims that that was why the kiss didn\\'t work, and the two engage in a heated argument before the balloons suddenly pop and they are sent falling into a lake. They narrowly escape a large fish and then an aggressive crane, followed by a group of hungry alligators from which they hide in an old tree and spend the night.\\n\\nIn the morning, Tiana makes a small raft so that the two can make their way back to New Orleans and become humans again. To her annoyance, Naveen doesn\\'t help with the paddling, and instead sits and plays a twig-guitar. Tia turns around to give him a piece of her mind, but sees a huge alligator that looks as if it\\'s about to eat up Naveen. To both of the frog\\'s surprise however, the alligator pulls out a trumpet and launches into a jam session with the prince, and introduces himself as Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley). Naveen explains that he and Tiana are both humans, turned into frogs by voodoo magic, to which Louis replies that a woman named Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis) is the voodoo queen of the bayou, and she can perform similar feats. As the journey to her lair is so dangerous however, he flatly refuses when the two ask if he can take them there. Disappointed, Tiana is about to return to her paddling, when Naveen hops off the raft and suavely persuades Louis to guide them to Mama Odie\\'s. He says that the witch could probably turn the toothy alligator into a human as well, so that he could fulfill his dream of playing with the jazz musicians of the city. This is too much for Louis, who swiftly agrees to take them there.\\n\\nBack at the La Bouffe\\'s, Charlotte and Lawrence, posing as Prince Naveen have tea together. Suddenly, one of Lawrence\\'s ears appears to swell up, although it has really just returned to it\\'s normal size. Worriedly, he checks the talisman and sees that half of the blood has been used up. He nervously blames his ear on mosquitoes, but just as quickly, his backside enlarges. Lawrence manipulates and maneuvres Charlotte so she can\\'t see his transformation back into his plump self, just as his chin and stomach swell up. To distract her, he hurriedly proposes to her, and Charlotte accepts before happily waltzing away. Dr. Facilier appears from nowhere and watches as all the blood is drained and Lawrence returns entirely to his former body. As the assistant had let Naveen free so that his blood was currently unavailable, the Shadow Man is forced to ask for help from his \\'friends on the other side\\'.\\n\\nMeanwhile in the bayou, Tiana tells Louis about her big plans for the restaurant. Quickly the trio realises their hunger, and the frogs try fruitlessly to catch flies for food. But their inexperience falis their attempt, as Naveen and Tiana\\'s tongues get tied in a knot. Louis tries to help but just makes the knot incredibly more complicated, before hurrying off to get a sharp stick. A firefly zooms down to observe the struggling couple, and chuckles at their discomfort. Soon enough however, he undoes the knot and introduces himself as Ray (Jim Cummings). The two explain their predicament to him, but the firefly says that they\\'re heading in the wrong way if they want to meet Mama Odie. Right on cue, Louis runs in waving a sharp stick in the air but Ray whispers to Tiana to never take directions from an alligator, as they\\'ll always get you lost. He then whistles, and immediately thousands of fireflies light up to show the group the way.\\n\\nDr. Facilier, back in his shop is asking large totem heads on the wall for assistance in retrieving Naveen, but they frown menacingly at his plea. As if expecting their negative answer however, Facilier assures them that as soon as he kills \\'Big Daddy\\' La Bouff, the \\'friends\\' can have all the souls of New Orleans for themselves. To this, the heads agree, and a multitude of shadows enter the room. Facilier orders them to find Naveen, and bring him back alive... for now.\\n\\nBack at the bayou, Ray is farewelling his relatives as he prepares to go with Tiana, Naveen and Louis the rest of the way. He reveals to Tiana that he is in love with Evangeline, but Naveen advises the firefly to not settle down so quickly. Louis is pricked by a bush and melodramatically wails in pain until Ray calms him down to pull out the thistles. As the group is preoccupied, a trio of hunters lies in wait, planning to catch and eat Tia and Naveen. Unaware of the danger they\\'re in, the two frogs walk away from the others, Tiana in front, chopping away at leaves in her path, and Naveen behind. After being told by Naveen that she doesn\\'t know how to have fun, Tia angrily retorts that he\\'s a lazy good-for-nothing. While they exchange heated words, Naveen is captured in a net by Reggie (Ritchie Montgomery), and Tia by Two Fingers (Paul Briggs). She escapes, just as Louis and Ray spots Reggie in a boat with guns, gloating over the prince. In his terror, Louis accidentally falls back in the thorn bushes, but the firefly flies up the old hunter\\'s nose to distract him and set Naveen free. Running away from Darnell (Don Hall), Tia inadvertently lands herself in a trap box and is promptly sat upon by Reggie to prevent her escape. The prince bobs out of the water, gleeful with his freedom but sees Tiana trapped, and follows the boat. He sits on Reggie\\'s head, causing Darnell to dimwittedly whack his father to try and hit the agile frog. Soon chaos ensues, and Tia is able to get out of her cage.\\n\\nNaveen and Tiana return to Louis and Ray after their ordeal, while the firefly impatiently yanks the thistles out of the pained alligator. To make him feel better, Tia makes swamp gumbo but insists Naveen help by mincing the mushrooms while she gathers peppers. She returns to find him struggling with the task, and smiling, helps him. The prince admits that since his charmed life in the castle, he doesn\\'t know how to do anything. One of the shadows under Facilier\\'s orders, meanwhile, finds flowers as evidence of the frogs and lets out a piercing call. Soon the other shadows follow him and they make their way towards the prince.\\n\\nAfter eating the swamp gumbo, Naveen compliments Tiana\\'s cooking, saying she has a gift to which she thanks him. Ray changes the subject though, pointing to the sky and telling the others that the Evening Star is Evangeline. He sings about his love for her, but when Louis moves to interrupt and tell him that his love is actually a star, Naveen throws a nutshell at him and gestures for him to be quiet. The prince asks Tia to dance with him, but she dejectedly hops to another lilypad and sadly tells him that she doesn\\'t dance. Naveen tugs her back near him however, and quietly tells her that if he can mince, she can dance. They begin dancing on a lilypad to Louis\\'s trumpet, while Ray creates mood lighting. The pair are about to kiss, until Tia pushes him away and remarks that Charlotte was getting herself a superb dance partner. Suddenly, the shadows grab and drag Naveen away, but although the others run after him, it doesn\\'t look like they\\'re fast enough. Bursts of light from nowhere, hit the shadows and destroy them, rendering Naveen free, and as the group looks for their saviour, they meet Mama Odie.\\n\\nShe brings them back to her tree house and introduces them to her pet python Juju, who she uses as a walking stick. Tiana and Naveen try to get her attention to turn them back into humans, but she interrupts each of their attempts, by offering them candy, falling asleep and going to her gumbo pot. Eventually she answers their questions by trying to teach them the difference of wants and needs. Tiana doesn\\'t understand however, so wearily Mama Odie shows them through the gumbo pot, how to turn human again; Naveen will have to kiss Charlotte before midnight, while she\\'s princess of the Mardi Gras parade.\\n\\nThe group decide to make their way to New Orleans by following Louis\\' suggestion, and they sneakily climb aboard the river boat. A group of musicians soon make their way past however, and while Naveen, Ray and Tiana can hide, Louis is too big, and is noticed by them. Luckily for both parties however, the alligator is thought to be a human inside an alligator costume, and excitedly plays the trumpet and follows them. Ray and Tiana go to watch Louis play with \\'the big boys\\', but Naveen mysteriously decides to stay back and says he\\'ll catch up with the others later. He then fashions a ring out of rope and a beaded bracelet, before asking Evangeline why he can\\'t just tell Tiana he loves her. Ray flies in in the wrong moment, and thinking Naveen is making a move on Evangeline begins to pummel him. Naveen quickly sets the record straight, but tells Ray to not tell Tiana about his love for her. Soon after, the prince leads Tia to a private dinner, where she is taken aback but delighted. He treats her to a minced dinner, but due to nerves, begins making mistakes, telling Tia he has dated thousands of women, then calling her one of the guys before tripping and upturning the food. She takes it in her stride though, giggling and saying she thinks it\\'s cute. Naveen is about to propose to her, but Tiana interrupts, pointing out her future restaurant and gushing about her plans for it. When she mentions, however, that she needs the money by the next day, or she\\'ll lose the restaurant forever, the prince realises he cannot marry her and disappointedly heads off. While Tiana talks to Evangeline, telling her about her uncertainty for the future, Naveen is being dragged off once again, by the shadows.\\n\\nCharlotte is seen knocking on a door, calling for Prince Naveen to hurry up for the Mardi Gras wedding, while Lawrence worriedly procrastinates, saying he\\'ll be ready shortly, but itching for Naveen\\'s blood so he can take his form again. The shadows suddenly appear, and toss the prince into Facilier\\'s hat, where they take more of his blood and drip it into the talisman. Back on the river boat, which has docked, everyone\\'s getting off to play at the Mardi Gras, but Tiana asks Ray where Naveen is. Ray lets slip that Naveen loves her, and that he plans to marry her after kissing Charlotte and getting them both turned back into humans. Giddy with joy, Tiana hops around the Mardi Gras, looking for the float where Naveen would be kissing Charlotte, but instead sees the Prince imposter about to marry her. Mistaking Lawrence for the actual prince, Tia is devastated and tunes out Ray as he wonders how it can be true, when Mama Odie specifically said both frogs would be turned human once again.\\n\\nTia hops off sadly, and Ray flies through the city looking for her. Once he does, he tries to comfort her but Tiana angrily bursts out that Evangeline isn\\'t real, and is just a star. Ray tearily tells Evangeline to not listen to Tia, and that she\\'s only speaking out of a broken heart, before flying off to put things right. As Lawrence prepares to wed Charlotte, Facilier chuckles, preparing to kill Big Daddy through the use of a voodoo doll. Ray finds Naveen locked inside a small chest right next to Lawrence, and quickly sets him free. Naveen launches himself at the former assistant, and the two go tumbling off the float. Lawrence runs off to dispose of the frog, but the prince takes the talisman off his neck and throws it to Ray who flies away with it. The shadows and Facilier run after the firefly, and to help him, Louis stops playing and growls, alerting the other musicians that he\\'s an actual alligator. As the crowd screams and parts, Louis runs off to help his friend.\\n\\nRay meanwhile, zooms towards Tiana, and quickly explains the nature of the talisman, claiming it proves that what they saw wasn\\'t the truth. Tiana hops off with the object, while Ray stays behind to destroy as many shadows as possible. With his light, he kills a few of them, but Facilier soon arrives and knocks the firefly to the ground, before disgustedly stepping on him. A few seconds later, Louis comes running, calling for Ray, but finds the firefly lying on the ground and makes off for Tiana.\\n\\nThe shadows and Facilier continue chasing Tiana, but when she threatens to break the talisman into a million pieces, the Shadow Man casts an enchantment on her, causing her to look human again, and changes the setting, to her dream restaurant. She thinks she sees Naveen playing the ukulele in the corner of the room, but when the man turns around, she sees it isn\\'t and is disappointed. Facilier meanwhile, tries to convince Tia to hand over the artifact, promising the restaurant and becoming a human again. When she refuses to, he brings up memories of her sacrifices and people doubting her abilities, and finally her father working hard but failing to get enough money for a restaurant. Facilier tells Tiana that she could get everything that her father ever wanted, but she determinedly tells the witch doctor that although her father never got what he wanted, he had what he needed. She throws the talisman to the ground, but it\\'s snatched up by Facilier\\'s shadow and the illusion immediately disappears.\\n\\nFacilier cackles and tells her that she should have taken his deal, but using her tongue, Tia takes the talisman back and shatters it on the ground. The Shadow Man is horrified, and frets how he won\\'t be able to pay back his debt. Totem heads come out of the stone heads, asking if he\\'s ready, which he replies that he isn\\'t. Voodoo dolls climb out of the ground, and in terror, he says that he has lots more plans, revealing that he has the prince locked away, to Tiana\\'s surprise. An enormous totem head sucks in Facilier\\'s shadow, and the hysterical witch doctor himself, to sacrifice his soul in exchange for his unpaid debts. Then the totem heads and voodoo dolls disappear, and a gravestone with the Shadow Man\\'s face on it appears.\\n\\nCharlotte angrily knocks on the door of the building which Lawrence is on, demanding that he open up. Finally, she breaks in, but instead of being the handsome Prince Naveen who she expects, fat, old Lawrence is the one who greets her. Horrified, she screams, and so does he, running past her into the night. The real prince, still in the form of a frog, calls her name, and after being squashed with a book, tells her who he is.\\n\\nTiana arrives, just in time to see Lawrence being hauled into the back of a police car. She then sees Charlotte and Naveen sitting on the steps, the latter explaining his and Tiana\\'s predicament. Charlotte expects marriage, to which Naveen reluctantly agrees but puts emphasis on money being given to Tiana for her restaurant, saying that she is his Evangeline. As they are about to kiss, Tiana stops Naveen but he tells her that it is the only way to get her her dream. But she quietly replies that her dream wouldn\\'t be complete, without him in it. Charlotte, seeing their love, agrees to kiss Naveen, without him having to marry her, but as she plants a kiss on him, the bell sounds, signalling midnight has passed. With seemingly no hope of becoming human again, the frogs smile sadly, but are content with being together, whether in frog or human form.\\n\\nLouis comes running, bringing Ray with him, and they stay with him through his last moments. Back at the bayou, his funeral ceremony is carried out, with the firefly lifted by his relatives, in a leaf, and sent floating on the river. As he disappears into the distance, a new star appears, right next to the Evening Star.\\n\\nNaveen and Tiana get married by Mama Odie, and as they kiss they both transform into humans. Surprised, they realise that by getting married, Tiana was now a princess, and by Naveen kissing her they were both changed back. They then get formally married as humans, to the delight of Eudora, and Naveen\\'s parents. As Tiana throws the bouquet, it\\'s caught by Charlotte\\n\\nAt Finner Bros. Realty, Tiana pushes over tins of her hard-earned money, and the brothers are encouraged by a growl from Louis to hand over the key to the restaurant. Tia and Naveen then get to work, and begin to redecorate and clean up the property, until it is beautifully furnished and Louis is shown to be playing the trumpet with a band, on the stage. The restaurant is full, and Charlotte, \\'Big Daddy\\' La Bouffe, Naveen\\'s parents and Eudora are all seated. Charlotte then dances with Naveen\\'s younger brother, who\\'s only six and a half but Charlotte says that she\\'s waited this long. Tiana and Naveen then dance and kiss on the roof of the restaurant.', 'Two clownfish, Marlin (Albert Brooks) and his wife Coral (Elizabeth Perkins), admire the view from their new home within a sea anemone overlooking the drop off of a coral reef. Below them, their clutch of eggs lies hidden in a small hole. Excited to be first-time parents, they discuss names, Coral expressing her fondness for \"Nemo.\" They flirt playfully with each other until Coral\\'s attention is distracted by the appearance of a barracuda. Ignoring Marlin\\'s order to hide, Coral moves to protect her eggs and the barracuda lunges. Marlin rushes in but the barracuda knocks him out with a flick of its tail, sending him back into the anemone. When he comes to that night, he discovers that Coral and the eggs are gone but manages to find a single surviving egg with a scratch on its right side. Vowing to protect it, he names the codling Nemo.\\n\\nMarlin raises Nemo (Alexander Gould) in a secure anemone further into the reef. On the morning of his first day of school, an excited Nemo wakes his father, flapping his tiny right fin wildly. Marlin helps him prepare for the day, showing to be overprotective and doubtful of Nemo\\'s ability to take care of himself. Marlin escorts Nemo to school -- along the way, Nemo asks Marlin how old sea turtles live to be; Marlin doesn\\'t have an answer. Mr. Ray (Bob Peterson), the local teacher, takes the children on a field trip. When Marlin learns that they are going to the drop off, he swims after them in a panic. Upon arrival Nemo follows three of his peers (Jordan Ranft, Erica Beck, and Erik Per Sullivan), bored with Mr. Ray\\'s lesson, to the very edge of the reef where they see a boat (misnaming it a \"butt\") anchored in the distance. They dare each other to swim out into open water to touch the \"butt\" as Marlin arrives and yells at Nemo for endangering himself. While talking to Mr. Ray, Marlin fails to notice Nemo swimming fiercely out to sea, stopping beneath the boat. In an act of defiance, Nemo touches the boat with his fin and starts to swim back before a diver suddenly appears behind him and traps him in a small bag. Marlin is prevented from swimming out after his son by another diver who takes a picture, disorienting him. Regaining his sight, Marlin swims after the divers as the boat departs the reef. The diver places Nemo in a cooler full of water and accidentally drops his mask into the water.\\n\\nMarlin swims after the boat but eventually loses the trail. He swims to the sea floor, begging passing schools of fish for help until he bumps into a regal tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). She claims to have seen the boat and leads a thankful Marlin in the direction it went but, as they swim along, she becomes lax and even tries to evade Marlin when she notices him behind her. When she confronts him, he questions her and she apologizes, telling Marlin she has short-term memory loss. Dumbfounded, Marlin turns to leave but is stopped by a great white shark who introduces himself as Bruce (Barry Humphries). He invites Marlin and Dory to a get-together he\\'s having and, despite Marlin\\'s objections, escorts them to his lair in a sunken submarine surrounded by live sea mines. They meet Bruce\\'s fellow sharks, hammerhead Anchor (Eric Bana) and mako Chum (Bruce Spence), before beginning an assembly where they pledge to abstain from eating fish.\\n\\nThe two are fairly terrified by the sharks until Marlin spots the diver\\'s mask stuck on a shard of metal. Inspecting it, he discovers markings on the strap that might provide a clue to Nemo\\'s whereabouts. Dory picks up the mask to see if the sharks can read but Marlin tries to take it back, engaging in a tug-of-war before the mask snaps into Dory\\'s face, causing a nosebleed. The smell of the blood excites Bruce\\'s inner carnivore and, though Anchor and Chum try to stage an intervention by holding him back, he mindlessly chases Marlin and Dory through the submarine, taking hold of the mask in his mouth in the process. During this time, Dory reveals that she can read human words before she and Marlin take refuge in a torpedo well. Dory releases the torpedo which wedges in Bruce\\'s mouth, giving Marlin enough time to grab the mask and flee back into the well. Bruce throws the torpedo away and Anchor and Chum are able to regain his attention in time before the torpedo sets off one of the mines, causing a violent chain reaction of explosions of the entire minefield.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Nemo is placed into a new container revealed to be a fish tank in a dentist\\'s office. There he meets a few of the original inhabitants including Bloat the puffer fish (Brad Garrett), Bubbles the yellow tang (Stephen Root), Peach the ochre sea star (Allison Janney), Gurgle the royal gramma (Austin Pendleton), Jacques the French-accented Pacific cleaner shrimp (Joe Ranft), and Deb (Vicki Lewis), a black-tailed humbug who believes her reflection to be her twin sister, Flo. A pelican named Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) perches himself on the window near the tank and greets Nemo after briefly discussing dental procedures with the other fish. He\\'s shooed away by the dentist (Bill Hunter) who shows Nemo a picture of his niece, Darla, whom Nemo has been promised to. The other fish cringe and call her a fish killer (\\'she wouldn\\'t stop shaking the bag\\'). Afraid and wanting to go home, Nemo backs away and gets stuck in the suction tube of the filter. The other fish go to help him but Gill (Willem Dafoe), a wise moorish idol with large scars on his right side, tells Nemo that he must escape himself, giving Nemo instructions and encouragement. Nemo manages to free himself and Peach relates his strength to his ocean origins, like Gill.\\n\\nMarlin and Dory awake in the aftermath of the explosions to find the submarine hanging precariously over the edge of a deep ravine. Their movements cause the submarine to suddenly tip forward and collide with the rock wall of the far side. During the chaos and blinded temporarily by the dust, Dory accidentally drops the mask into the darkness below. Marlin gives it up for lost but Dory cheerfully takes him into the depths, telling him to just keep swimming. After a moment, they come upon a mysterious and alluring light which, unfortunately, belongs to a hungry anglerfish. During the chase, Marlin finds the mask and distracts the anglerfish long enough so that Dory can read the address written on it. Marlin then leads the anglerfish towards the mask and traps it using the masks strap as a tether. Dory recites the address \\'P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney\\' and is ecstatic to find that she can remember it.\\n\\nBack in the fish tank, Nemo is woken by Jacques who takes him to the tank\\'s toy volcano (Mt. Wannahockaloogie) where the other fish perform an initiation to include Nemo in their club, giving him the nickname \"Shark Bait.\" Gill then proposes a plan to escape the fish tank by jamming the gear in the filter which would cause the tank to become so dirty that the dentist will have to manually clean it and place the fish in baggies on the counter, allowing them to roll out the window to the street, cross it, and land in the harbor. Though the other fish are skeptical, Gill asserts that Nemo is small enough to fit into the filter and make it back through the tubing. Nemo agrees to do it.\\n\\nMarlin and Dory continue their journey and request directions to Sydney from a school of moonfish (John Ratzenberger). They tell Marlin and Dory to take the East Australian Current (EAC), after an impressive display of their synchronized impressions. When they come to a rocky trench. Marlin resolves to swim over it to avoid the ominous enclosure. With the EAC in view, Dory becomes distracted and is stung by a tiny jellyfish. As Marlin tends to her, they are suddenly surrounded by a school of larger jellyfish. Finding that the tops don\\'t sting, Marlin and Dory bounce on them as they race out of the school. Marlin makes it out first and, when Dory doesn\\'t appear, goes back in to retrieve her. He finds her unconscious and scarred from the stinging and struggles to carry her out as he is repeatedly stung. He makes it but, stung and exhausted, blacks out as a large shadow descends on him.\\n\\nNemo waits in the fish tank with Gill who is keeping an eye on the dentist for an opportune moment to jam the filter. Noticing Nemo looking at his scars, Gill explains that during his first escape attempt he landed on dental tools, though he was aiming for the toilet. He says that all drains lead to the ocean and that fish weren\\'t meant to live in a tank. Peach cries out that the dentist is going for a bathroom break which cues Nemo to leap into the filter. Gill tosses him a pebble and gives instructions as Nemo wedges the fan, stopping the flow of water. However, as he is moving through the pipe back into the tank, the pebble unhinges and the fan turns on again, sucking Nemo backwards. The other fish hurry and send Nemo a toy kelp strand to grab onto and pull him out. Shaken, Peach asks Gill not to send Nemo in the filter again. Sullen and realizing his plan put Nemo in grave danger, Gill says they\\'re done.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Marlin wakes up to find himself resting on the shell of a laid-back sea turtle with a surfer\\'s attitude who introduces himself as Crush (Andrew Stanton). Incredulous, he discovers that he\\'s also riding along the EAC with dozens of other sea turtles and large fish. Marlin is reunited with Dory who sports a scar on her side from the jellyfish stings and meets Crush\\'s son, Squirt (Nicholas Bird). Marlin also meets Crush\\'s spirited son, Squirt. While playing with the other sea turtles, Squirt is accidentally propelled outside the current. Marlin is panicky at first however Crush convinces him that Squirt can handle himself. Squirt is able to swim his way back into the current & gleefully joins his father. Marlin sees that even the youngest among the turtles can learn to survive in the ocean. Having been told some details of their journey and the encounter with the jellyfish, Squirt and the other hatchlings ask Marlin to tell them the rest of the story. Hesitant at first, Marlin relents and begins with when Nemo was abducted. His story is not ignored; it\\'s passed on from turtle to fish to dolphin to bird and onward until it reaches Nigel the pelican. Hearing Nemo\\'s name, he flies off to the dentist\\'s office. There, Nemo tries to apologize to Gill for the botched escape attempt but Gill says that his eagerness to escape almost cost Nemo his life and that nothing should be worth that. Nigel arrives, crashing into the closed window, but recovers and is able to tell Nemo the story of Marlin\\'s journey as it was told to him. When Nigel suggests that Nemo\\'s father took on three sharks and a school of jellyfish, Nemo is newly impressed with his father. Invigorated, Nemo takes it upon himself to try the filter attempt again and, this time, succeeds.\\n\\nMarlin and Dory continue along the EAC until they come to their exit point where Crush and Squirt show them where to depart the main line. After a confusing instructional speech on \"proper exiting technique\" Squirt pushes them into the exit flume and back into open water. Thanking Crush, Marlin asks the turtle how old he is; Crush answers that\\'s he\\'s \"150 years old & still young!\" They are instructed to continue through a large purplish plume of plankton to Sydney. However, they soon become lost and Dory resolves to ask a distant fish for directions. Though Marlin is afraid at first, he decides to trust Dory and she calls out to the distant figure. When she sees its a minke whale, she starts speaking \\'whale\\', asking for help. Marlin grows frustrated with her again just as a whale approaches from behind and pulls them into its mouth.\\n\\nBack in the fish tank, a couple of days\\' worth without a filter has rendered every surface covered in green algae. When the dentist sees this, he opts to clean the tank the following morning before Darla\\'s arrival. Nemo looks out the window to the harbor outside, wondering if his father is there already, waiting for him.\\n\\nIn the whale\\'s mouth, Marlin and Dory remain safe with enough water to swim in. Though Dory is complacent, Marlin futilely attempts to break out by ramming into the whale\\'s baleen. He yells at Dory for claiming to have spoken whale, calling her insane and lamenting over the fact that he\\'ll never see his son again. Dory tries to console him as the whale emits a call and the water in the mouth begins to drain. The whale then lifts his tongue to push Marlin and Dory to the back of its throat but Marlin refuses to let go until Dory assures him that, though she doesn\\'t know what will happen, everything will be all right. Marlin closes his eyes and releases his grip on the whale\\'s tongue. They fall to the back of the throat where they are then shot out of the whale\\'s blowhole, landing in Sydney Harbor. Overjoyed to have finally arrived, Marlin sends his thanks to the whale and encourages Dory to help him find the boat that took Nemo.\\n\\nThe following morning, Peach wakes up with the horrified realization that the tank is suddenly clean. The fish find that the dentist had installed a new high-tech filter the night before and, though they are impressed with the fluid functionality of the device, they worry about what they will do when Darla arrives. The dentist suddenly pulls Nemo up in a fish net but Gill and the other fish swim into it and instruct Nemo to swim down, pulling the net into the tank and away from the dentist\\'s grip. Despite their efforts, Nemo is quickly scooped up in a plastic bag and set on the counter. The other fish tell Nemo to roll out the window but, before he can get far, the dentist places the baggie in a tin to keep him from moving. Gill tries to assure Nemo that he\\'ll be OK but, at that moment, Darla (LuLu Ebeling) crashes into the office.\\n\\nMarlin and Dory continue to search the harbor, both tired from looking at boats all night, when they are scooped up in the beak of a pelican. The pelican lands on a nearby dock and swallows them but Marlin refuses to have come this far just to be breakfast. He lodges himself and Dory in the pelican\\'s neck, causing it to start choking. Nearby, Nigel wakes from a nap to notice the pelican, Jerry, choking and flies down to assist. He hits Jerry in the back, expelling Marlin and Dory from his mouth onto the dock where Marlin shouts out that he needs to find Nemo. Recognizing the name, Nigel turns to Jerry excitedly and tells him this is the fish that they\\'ve been hearing about. When he turns back to Marlin, he sees that he and Dory have flopped their way towards the end of the dock. Nigel chases after them but they are all forced to freeze when they notice that they are surrounded by hungry seagulls. When Nigel tells Marlin that he knows his son, Nemo, Marlin flips in excitement, causing the seagulls to rush forward, but Nigel manages to take Dory and Marlin in his mouth and fly off.\\n\\nDarla torments the fish in the tank before going in to see her uncle. As he picks up the baggie with Nemo inside, he notices Nemo floating upside down. The other fish quickly realize that Nemo is feigning death so that he can be flushed down the toilet but the dentist moves towards the trash can just as Nigel arrives in the window. Marlin forces Nigel into the office and the dentist drops the baggie. Marlin sees Nemo floating and believes him to be dead as the dentist grabs Nigel and forces him out the window again, Marlin calling out to Nemo. Hearing his name, Nemo pops upright but Darla takes the bag and starts shaking it, trying to \\'wake up the fishy\\'. Gill lodges himself into the top of Mt. Wannahockaloogie and the force of the bubbles propels him out of the tank. He lands on Darla\\'s head and she drops Nemo\\'s bag on a table full of tools, breaking the plastic. Gill falls off Darla\\'s head next to Nemo and flips him into the sink and down the drain using a magnifying scope as a catapult. The dentist quickly puts Gill back into the tank where he can breathe. Gill tells the others not to worry about Nemo; that all drains lead to the ocean. Darla is upset and receives a squirt of water in her face from the sink.\\n\\nNemo travels down the piping until he reaches a water treatment filtration, a series of piping that travels on the sea floor out of the harbor. Nigel flies out of the harbor with Marlin and Dory and releases them into the water, offering his condolences. Distraught, Marlin thanks Dory for helping him and begins to swim away. She asks him to stay with her and that her memory is better when he\\'s around, that she doesn\\'t want to forget. Marlin refuses and swims away, leaving her alone.\\n\\nNemo emerges from the piping and calls out for his father. He finds Dory swimming confusedly under a buoy, saying that she\\'s lost someone but can\\'t remember. Nemo offers to search with her and Dory happily complies, though she doesn\\'t recognize him. As they swim together, Dory comes upon a piece of piping and reads \\'Sydney\\' on it. Suddenly, all of her memories come flooding back to her and she rushes at Nemo, hugging him fiercely, before leading him in the direction Marlin went. They find out that Marlin headed towards fishing grounds and reunite with him amongst a large school of fish. The school of fish then cries out in panic as a large net from a fishing boat above envelopes them. Dory is caught up in the netting and Nemo says that he must swim in and instruct the fish to swim down. Though Marlin fears for Nemo\\'s safety, he lets go and allows Nemo to do what he can. Marlin instructs the panicked fish from outside the net and they all soon start swimming in synch downwards, pulling the net with them until it finally snaps away from the boat, freeing all the fish. Marlin and Dory find Nemo under the heavy netting -- Marlin is stricken with grief, believing Nemo is dead. Nemo regains consciousness & Marlin gently tells him that he found out that sea turtles live to be 150 years old.\\n\\nMarlin and Nemo come to an understanding and all three go back to their home in the reef. Marlin\\'s demeanor has changed for the better and he is more upbeat and confident in his son\\'s abilities. He takes him to school where Dory is dropped off by Bruce, Anchor, and Chum who have included Dory in their vegetarian program. Nemo hugs his father before heading off on another field trip with Mr. Ray. Marlin watches them leave, knowing that his son will be all right.\\n\\nBack at the dental office in Sydney, the dentist curses the high-tech filter which has suddenly stopped working. He complains about having to put all the fish in baggies but notices that they have mysteriously disappeared from the counter. Horns honk out the open window as Peach is the last to cross the street and land herself in the harbor with the other fish. As they float in their baggies, unable to escape confinement, Bloat wonders \\'Now what?\\'\\n\\nIn a post-credits stinger, the tiny fish that was Chum\\'s \"friend\" at the support group is stalked by the anglerfish. As the anglerfish moves in to swallow him, the tiny fish suddenly opens his mouth to a surprisingly enormous size and swallows the angler.', 'The film opens on a Wanted poster for Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) which is mounted to a tree. Flynn\\'s voice narrates: \"This is the story of how I died. But don\\'t worry, this is actually a fun story and the truth is it isn\\'t even mine. This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel, and it starts with the sun.\"\\n\\nCenturies ago, a droplet of sunlight falls from the sky and lands on Earth. When it touches the ground, a radiant, yellow flower blossoms. This flower is said to be capable of great healing power. One day, an old crone named Gothel (Donna Murphy) finds the flower and discovers that, when she sings a certain song to it (\"Flower, gleam and glow. Let your power shine. Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine, what once was mine\"), it emits a power that restores her youth. Vain and possessive of the flower, Gothel hides it beneath a woven basket and regularly returns to it to keep herself young.\\n\\nTime goes by and soon a prosperous kingdom is built up nearby. The ruling king and queen of Corona desperately wish for a child and, when the queen finally becomes pregnant, the entire kingdom celebrates. However, the queen soon falls deathly ill. Upon hearing a rumor that speaks of the legendary sun flower, the king spares no time and dispatches his soldiers to find it. Soon enough, the soldiers discover the flower that, in her haste to hide, Gothel forgot to cover. They bring it back to the castle and distill it into an elixir which is given to the queen. To everyone\\'s great relief, she recovers and soon gives birth to a beautiful baby girl who, unlike her brunette parents, has shining golden hair. The royal family marks the occasion by lighting a paper lantern decorated with the emblem of a sun and release it into the sky.\\n\\nGothel, however, is not pleased. She is determined not to lose the magical powers that gave her eternal youth, so she breaks into the castle late one night and finds the baby princess lying in her crib. She recites the old song and the baby\\'s hair glows just as the flower had. Gothel attempts to cut just enough hair to keep but the clipped hair turns brown in her hands, void of its power. Desperate, Gothel resolves to kidnap the princess and flee with her deep into the forest. She takes the baby to a secret tower hidden in an alcove where she gives her the name Rapunzel and raises her as her own daughter. She teaches the girl to sing the old song to make her hair glow and restore Gothel\\'s beauty and keeps her hidden from the world, telling her that it is for her own safety and that anyone on the outside wouldn\\'t hesitate to steal her magic hair. The only access to the world Rapunzel has is a wide window from which Mother Gothel comes and goes, using Rapunzel\\'s 70 foot long hair as a rope ladder. Despite playing the part as \\'mother\\', Gothel often cruelly teases Rapunzel and guilt-trips her whenever she is upset or disappointed, dramatically proclaiming, \"now I\\'m the bad guy\".\\n\\nAs the years pass, Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) becomes fascinated by an annual event that seems to happen only on her birthday. That night, every year, she witnesses thousands of floating lights in the sky, brighter than the stars and beautiful in all their colors. Unknown to her, it is the releasing of the paper lanterns that her biological parents are making in tradition of their daughter who they hope will return to them one day. Eighteen years later, Rapunzel is a creative young woman, finding numerous ways to keep herself entertained during the day while Mother Gothel is away, including painting, cleaning, brushing, and playing hide and seek with her pet chameleon Pascal. Though she is happy with her life in the tower, she longs to someday explore the outside world and see the place where the lanterns in the sky come from.\\n\\nWithin the kingdom, standing on the roof of the castle, young thief Flynn Rider goes over the plans to his latest heist with his associates, the Stabbington brothers (Ron Perlman). They use a rope to lower Flynn into the throne room where the missing princess\\'s prized tiara sits on a guarded pedestal. Flynn steals the priceless artifact and is hoisted back to the roof with the palace guards hot in pursuit, led by the Captain of the Guard (M.C. Gainey) and his loyal horse, Maximus. The thieves make it outside the kingdom and seek refuge in the forest but soon come to a dead end in a ditch. The Stabbington brothers tell Flynn that, if he gives them the satchel with the tiara in it, they\\'ll hoist him up to the high ledge above. Once at the top, they then command that Flynn help them up. But Flynn reveals that he still has the tiara in a second satchel. Double crossing the brothers, he ditches them and runs into the forest.\\n\\nSeeking refuge, Flynn comes to Rapunzel\\'s tower and climbs the vines to the open window above. Seemingly alone, he takes the tiara out of his satchel to admire it, but Rapunzel knocks him out with a frying pan. She and Pascal step forward cautiously to investigate the intruder. Pascal, using his color schemes, advises Rapunzel to be wary of the young man since Gothel has often told stories of men bearing sharp teeth. However, Rapunzel finds nothing outwardly menacing about Flynn and hides him in her closet as Mother Gothel comes home. Rapunzel decides that she will show Mother Gothel the young man, proving that she can take care of herself, in hopes that she will be let out of the tower for her approaching 18th birthday. However, when Rapunzel plucks up the courage to ask to leave the tower and see the floating lights, Mother Gothel spurns her request. She tells Rapunzel that the world is much too dangerous for someone as naïve as her and that she is never to leave the tower, singing that \"Mother Knows Best\".\\n\\nRapunzel solemnly promises not to ask to leave the tower again and, thinking it pointless now, keeps from telling Mother Gothel that she has a stranger locked away in her closet. Instead, she asks if Mother Gothel could restore her white paint by collecting special white seashells for her birthday. Mother Gothel is hesitant about making the three day journey to the shore, but acquiesces and leaves. Once out of sight, Rapunzel takes Flynn out of the closet and uses her hair to tie him up to a chair. When he comes to, she proposes a deal. She will give him his satchel with the tiara back (which she has hidden) if he takes her to see the floating lights and brings her back to the tower before Mother Gothel returns. Flynn reluctantly agrees.\\n\\nOutside the tower, Rapunzel digs her toes into grass for the first time and runs about the forest in bursts of elation and panic while Flynn can only watch. While excited to be out in the world for the first time, Rapunzel feels equally ashamed for having defied her mother. Despite her guilt and confusion, she assures Flynn that she is fine enough to continue the journey. Hoping to dissuade her, Flynn takes her to the nearby Snuggly Duckling Inn, a tavern which is frequented by an assortment of thugs and bandits. Flynn\\'s plan to scare Rapunzel into going back to the tower backfires when the thugs recognize him from wanted posters and attempt to hold him for a reward while one of their associates goes to tip off the guards. Rapunzel pleads with them to release Flynn and asks if any of them have ever had a dream. Her innocence melts their hearts and they all confess their dreams. When the guards arrive at the inn, they stage a distraction to help Rapunzel and Flynn escape through a secret tunnel and encourage her to live her dream.\\n\\nAs they make their way down the tunnel, the horse Maximus arrives at the inn and sniffs Flynn\\'s trail to the secret trapdoor. He leads the guards to a large quarry where they corner Rapunzel and Flynn. Maximus unhinges a large wooden beam to try and get to them but this renders the dam overlooking the quarry unstable. It collapses and a wave of water surges into the quarry. Rapunzel and Flynn become trapped inside a cave as falling rocks block the entrance. Water begins to flood into the cave and, realizing their doom, Rapunzel and Flynn each admit a secret to the other. Flynn confesses that his true name is Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel tells him that her hair glows when she sings. However, she realizes that she can use that to her advantage and begins singing. Her glowing hair illuminates a break in the rocks where water flows out and Flynn manages to dislodge the rocks, injuring his hand slightly, and break out the other side.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Maximus the horse jumps out in front of Mother Gothel startling her, she immediately panics that his rider (a palace guard) has located Rapunzel and rescued her. She is shocked to discover Rapunzel gone and even more surprised when she finds the tiara hidden under the staircase with a satchel and a wanted poster of Flynn. Bent on retrieving Rapunzel, Gothel takes the satchel and tiara and sets out to search for her. She manages to track Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, through the secret passage, into the quarry, and through the cave into the forest once more. There, she is confronted by the Stabbington brothers, but uses them to her advantage by bargaining their help for the tiara, revenge against Flynn for double-crossing them, and \\'something worth much more\\'.\\n\\nThat evening, Rapunzel and Eugene set up camp and Rapunzel reveals to Eugene that her hair does not just glow as she wraps it around his injured hand. She sings and, as her hair glows, it heals Eugene\\'s injury, to his shock. He asks her not to spread word of his true name for fear that it would ruin his reputation, explaining that he adopted his current pseudonym of \\'Flynn Rider\\' as an orphan, inspired by stories of a thief named \\'Flynn\\'. Growing up, he dreamed of having enough money to travel the world and relished the freedom of it all. Even so, Rapunzel tells him that she actually prefers his real name.\\n\\nWhen Eugene leaves to gather more firewood, Mother Gothel appears to Rapunzel from the nearby bushes and tells her that they must return to the tower. Rapunzel refuses to leave and tells Mother Gothel that she thinks Eugene likes her. Mother Gothel scoffs at the idea and tells Rapunzel that Flynn is only interested in one thing before revealing the satchel with the tiara. She tells Rapunzel to prove her wrong and test Eugene by giving him the satchel but not to come crying if he takes it and leaves. Unsure but fearful that Mother Gothel may be right, Rapunzel hides the satchel as Flynn returns. They settle down for the night while Gothel and the Stabbington brothers keep an eye on them nearby.\\n\\nThe next morning, Eugene wakes to see a soaking wet Maximus glaring angrily down at him. Maximus attempts to carry Eugene off but Rapunzel befriends the horse and convinces him to let Eugene stay with her until after she sees the floating lights. Maximus relents but accompanies the pair as they travel into the kingdom. The marketplace is alive with vendors and townsfolk preparing for the sky lantern festival and Rapunzel\\'s hair is tightly braided to prevent it from dragging. While she and Eugene tour the kingdom, she notices a large tile portrait of the Royal family, including a baby with golden hair. Eugene finds himself growing fond of Rapunzel and, as the time for the lanterns to be released approaches, takes her out on a boat to the middle of the lake surrounding the castle. There, they watch in awe as the lights are released and the sky is filled with a soft orange glow. One lantern with a sun emblem on it floats down and Rapunzel gently pushes it back skyward. She then reveals the satchel she had been hiding to Eugene but, unlike what Mother Gothel predicted, he puts it aside and takes Rapunzel\\'s hands in his.\\n\\nBefore they can kiss, Eugene spies the Stabbington brothers on the nearby shore. He rows the boat in, tells Rapunzel to wait, and goes to meet them with the satchel. Realizing that he cares more about Rapunzel than the tiara, he gives the satchel to the brothers but they reveal they\\'re no longer interested in the tiara. While she waits by the boat, Rapunzel is shocked to see the Stabbington brothers approach. They tell her that Eugene betrayed her trust and point to his silhouette in a boat on the lake before attempting to kidnap her for her hair\\'s power. Horrified, Rapunzel tries to run but her long hair gets caught on a tree log. Before the brothers can grab her, Mother Gothel appears and knocks both of them unconscious. In tears and promising to never disobey her again, Rapunzel leaves with Mother Gothel back to the tower.\\n\\nEugene\\'s boat, meanwhile, docks just outside the palace. Maximus watches from nearby as Flynn comes to, having been knocked out and tied to the mast of the boat with the tiara beside him. The guards on the dock immediately arrest him.\\n\\nBack within the confines of the tower, Mother Gothel comforts Rapunzel and tells her that they shall put this whole experience behind them. As she walks up to her room, Rapunzel notices a recurring theme: all around her, painted on the walls and embroidered on her bed sheets, is the same sun emblem that she saw within the kingdom and on the very lantern she pushed skyward. She remembers the baby with golden blonde hair held by her brown-haired parents and suddenly realizes that she is the missing princess! She confronts Gothel about this who admits the truth but maintains that everything she did was for Rapunzel\\'s protection. When Rapunzel asks what\\'s to become of Eugene, Gothel tells her that he is to be executed. Enraged, Rapunzel goes to leave but Gothel resolves to \\'be the bad guy\\' and approaches her menacingly.\\n\\nAs he is led to the gallows, Eugene sees the Stabbington brothers incarcerated in their own cell. He demands to know what has happened to Rapunzel and they admit that they were acting under the promises of Mother Gothel to get Rapunzel back. Eugene struggles to escape, knowing that Rapunzel is in danger, but is unable to. Maximus then arrives with a few of the thugs from the Snuggly Duckling (Jeffrey Tambor, Brad Garrett, Paul F. Tompkins, and Richard Kiel) and they help Eugene break out so that he can ride out to Rapunzel\\'s tower.\\n\\nBeneath the tower, he calls out to Rapunzel and her hair is let down for him to climb. When he reaches the top, however, he finds Rapunzel bound and gagged in a chair. Before she can warn him, Gothel emerges from the shadows and stabs Eugene in the side with her dagger. He reels back, falling against a vanity mirror and breaking the glass. Gothel then tells Rapunzel that she will take her far away where no one will ever find her. Struggling against her gag, Rapunzel promises that she will go with Gothel willingly if she is allowed to heal Eugene. Gothel agrees and Rapunzel goes to the dying Eugene. Before she can begin singing he pulls her close and cuts her hair with shard of glass. With the enchantment broken, Rapunzel\\'s hair turns into its normal brown and Gothel staggers back as her skin begins to wrinkle. Horrified by her reflection, she trips over some of Rapunzel\\'s cut hair and falls out the window. By the time her cloak hits the ground, she\\'s rapidly aged into a pile of ashes.\\n\\nWith his dying breath, Eugene tells Rapunzel that she was his new dream and she tells him the same. Crying over him, Rapunzel recites her song one last time. A lone tear falls from her eyes into Eugene\\'s and the last bit of magic that remained in her revives him. The two lovers embrace and kiss before traveling together back to the castle where Rapunzel is reunited with her real parents. Eugene, now addressed by his true name, is welcomed into the Royal family. He and Rapunzel are soon married and live happily ever after.', 'No Synopsis', 'A Viking boy called Hiccup (voice: Jay Baruchel) introduces his village of Berk (\"it\\'s been here for seven generations, but every single building is new\"). The village is attacked by dragons, who steal food (mostly sheep) and set things on fire (hence all the new buildings). The villagers grab weapons and try to fight the dragons off. Despite being told by every adult in sight to go indoors, Hiccup hauls out a bolas-shooting cannon he made himself and shoots a dragon out of the night sky. (As assistant to the village blacksmith, Gobber (voice: Craig Ferguson), Hiccup has access to tools and materials and knows how to use them.) The dragon lands in the woods some distance form the village and no one believes that he hit anything, so it\\'s the next day before Hiccup can go looking for it. It turns out to be a rare and deadly Night Fury, but Hiccup can\\'t make himself kill it. Instead he releases it -- whereupon it also refrains from killing Hiccup -- and it flies off through the trees.\\n\\nHiccup discovers that the dragon (which he eventually calls Toothless because of its retractable teeth) has holed up in a steep-sided valley because it can no longer fly more than a few feet at a time. While sketching the dragon, Hiccup realizes that it\\'s missing a tail fin. He makes a prosthetic tail fin out of leather. The new fin helps, but Toothless can\\'t control it and inadvertently takes Hiccup for a ride, giving him a clear idea of what\\'s needed to help the dragon fly right. In a series of workshop and test flight scenes, Hiccup builds and perfects a saddle, a control mechanism for the tail fin, and a safety harness.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Hiccup\\'s father Stoick (voice: Gerard Butler) has signed him up for dragon training with Gobber, which is very different from the training he\\'s already doing with Toothless: he\\'s going to learn to fight dragons. At first, he\\'s the worst student in the class. Since Hiccup has always been an accident-prone klutz, this comes as no surprise to his classmates Astrid (voice: America Ferrera), Snotlout (voice: Jonah Hill), Fishlegs (voice: Christopher Mintz-Plasse), Ruffnut (voice: Kristen Wiig), and her twin brother Tuffnut (voice: T.J. Miller). (Hiccup\\'s a little sweet on Astrid.) Before long, Hiccup is able to use some things he\\'s learned while working with Toothless to soothe and manage the school\\'s practice dragons. (It turns out dragons are just big kitty-cats: they like to be petted, there\\'s a kind of grass that\\'s like cat-nip to them, and they love fish (but hate eels).) When Stoick returns from a failed search for the fabled nest of the dragons, he\\'s surprised but thrilled to hear that his son is doing brilliantly at dragon training. He gives Hiccup a horned helmet made from one of his dead mother\\'s breastplates. But Hiccup, as usual, is unable to get around his father\\'s expectations and speak frankly, so he can\\'t explain that his success at dragon school is unlikely to lead to the slaying of any dragons.\\n\\nWhen Hiccup subdues a practice dragon, unintentionally earning the privilege of killing it before the entire village, he\\'s horrified and decides to flee with Toothless. However Astrid, having noticed Hiccup\\'s frequent disappearances and secretive behavior, is suspicious. She follows him to the hidden valley and sees Toothless. Unable to explain his relationship with the dragon, Hiccup takes her flying, and she\\'s captivated. But they get caught up in a flock of dragons returning to their nest carrying food. The dragons fly inside a mountainous island and drop the food into a pit, which turns out to contain a huge, terrifying, and very hungry dragon that eats the smaller ones if they don\\'t bring it enough food. Hiccup and Astrid and shocked to realize that the dragons have been stealing their sheep to keep from being eaten themselves. When they get home, Hiccup convinces Astrid not to reveal the location of the dragon nest. Before she goes, she punches him in the arm and says \"That\\'s for kidnapping me.\" Then she kisses him and says \"That\\'s for everything else.\"\\n\\nEverything goes wrong at the dragon-killing ceremony. Hiccup discards his weapons in an attempt to show the Vikings that dragons only fight to defend themselves, but Stoick and others intervene and the dragon attacks. Toothless comes to the rescue and is on the verge of killing Stoick when Hiccup calls Toothless off. Despite Hiccup\\'s protests, the angry Vikings chain Toothless up. When he ineptly tries to explain, Hiccup lets it slip that Toothless took him to the nest of the dragons, and Stoick resolves to use Toothless to find the nest again. He won\\'t listen to Hiccup\\'s warnings about the giant dragon. He loads Toothless on his ship and the Viking fleet sails off with all the warriors in the village, disowning Hiccup and leaving him behind. When Hiccup wonders aloud why he didn\\'t kill Toothless when he had the chance since it would have avoided all of this, Astrid challenges him to explain why. In doing so, Hiccup comes to an epiphany about his moral character, his personal strength and Astrid\\'s faith in him. Inspired, Hiccup and his classmates mount the practice dragons and fly off in pursuit of the fleet.\\n\\nAt the dragons\\' island, the Vikings use catapults to break open the side of the mountain in which the giant dragon is trapped. When it comes out, Stoick realizes that he\\'s made a mistake. He resolves to fight it himself to buy the other Vikings time to escape; Gobber volunteers to join him. While Stoick and Gobber prepare to sacrifice themselves to distract the dragon, the kids arrive to join the battle. They do manage to distract the giant dragon a little, but it sets the Vikings\\' ships on fire. While his comrades keep the giant dragon occupied, Hiccup tries to rescue Toothless (who\\'s still in chains) from the burning ship, but they end up under water and Stoick rescues both of them. Then Toothless and Hiccup go after the giant dragon together. They draw it up into the clouds and away from the Vikings, trying to get it to crash on the island. In the end Toothless releases a blast into the giant dragon\\'s open mouth and it crashes and burns, apparently taking our heroes down with it -- we see Hiccup fall toward the fire as Toothless tries desperately to catch him. On the ground, a heartbroken Stoick approaches the wounded Toothless wondering what has become of his son; Toothless opens his wings to show that he saved Hiccup. (\"Well, most of him,\" Gobber remarks cryptically.)\\n\\nBack at home, Hiccup wakes up and Toothless urges him out of bed. Hiccup finds that he lost his left foot in the battle with the giant dragon. However, Gobber has made him a new one, ingeniously spring-loaded. (Hiccup and Toothless now have matching disabilities.) They go out into the village, which is full of swooping, frolicking dragons; the Vikings now treat them as pets. Astrid greets Hiccup with a kiss. Supplied by Gobber with a new tail fin prosthetic and saddle for Toothless, Hiccup takes flight with Astrid and his friends as he exults at the new alliance of Vikings and Dragons.', 'No Synopsis', 'No Synopsis', 'No Synopsis', 'A Dystopia in the Future\\n\\nApproximately seven hundred years in the future, the Earth is over-run with garbage and devoid of plant and animal life, the consequence of years of environmental degradation and thoughtless consumerism. The surviving humans are living on the spaceship Axiom after vacating Earth centuries earlier. Axiom is operated by a large corporation called Buy N Large, whose BnL logo appears even on the artificial sun visible from the ship\\'s main concourse. The original plan was for humans to live in outer space for 5 years while cleaning robots (\"WALL-Es\" invented by Professor Simon) prepared Earth for recolonization. However, after seven hundred years, only one WALL-E (voice: Ben Burtt) remains.\\n\\nWALL-E spends his days compacting debris into solid blocks and building structures with them. He also collects some of the more interesting artifacts and keeps them in the garage he shares with a cockroach, his only friend. At night he watches Hello Dolly on VHS and dreams of having a hand to hold. Most of his finds are spare parts and electronics but one day he discovers a lonely plant. Not sure what it is, but recognizing that it needs soil and care, he picks it up and puts it in a dirt-filled old shoe.\\n\\nThe next day, an enormous spaceship lands and deposits another robot, EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, voice: Elissa Knight). WALL-E is immediately smitten and hopes to hold her hand, but EVE is quick to use her plasma cannon, which can blast a hole through anything. EVE flies around Earth looking for vegetation but becomes distraught upon not finding any. WALL-E is finally able to approach her and takes her back to his garage where he shows her his collection of human artifacts. She still resists holding his hand, however, so he shows her the plant he found. This activates her prime directive: she takes the plant into a special containment capsule within her body, sends a signal to the mother ship, and goes into hibernation mode. Confused, WALL-E tries to make her safe and comfortable. He shelters her from thunderstorms and takes her to a park where he can watch the sunset next to her.\\n\\nSeveral days later, the mother ship returns and collects EVE. WALL-E hitches a ride on the ship, which returns to the Axiom several light years away from Earth. EVE and WALL-E are examined in the landing bay. EVE, still in hibernation mode, is taken away to the ship\\'s commander. WALL-E pursues her, followed by M-O (voice: Ben Burtt), a cleaning robot who is intent on scrubbing the filthy WALL-E to remove foreign contaminants (i.e. dirt or earth). On the way, WALL-E sees humans for the first time. Obese and largely unable to move on their own, they are carted around the Axiom in hover chairs with video screens that allow them to communicate with one another and see a variety of advertisements for drinkable food products. When WALL-E accidentally knocks one of the humans, John (voice: John Ratzenberger), off his hover chair, WALL-E helps the man back into the chair and introduces himself. Confused but grateful, John introduces himself in return.\\n\\nWALL-E tracks EVE to the chambers of Captain McCrea (voice: Jeff Garlin), who is just as inert and catered to as the other humans. McCrea is confused but excited about Operation Recolonize, which is triggered by EVE\\'s find. But when McCrea reactivates EVE and orders her to produce the plant, it is missing. McCrea orders EVE and WALL-E to be taken for repairs but, after they\\'ve left, decides to educate himself about Earth. In the repair bay, WALL-E mistakenly thinks EVE is being harmed by the repair crew and uses her plasma cannon to save her, inadvertently releasing other robots who had been taken in for service. During the breakout, security robots take photos of them; the ship\\'s computer announces to humans that EVE and WALL-E are renegade robots. Angry, EVE takes WALL-E to an escape pod to send him back to Earth. Before she can put him in the pod, they see Gopher putting the plant in the escape pod. After Gopher leaves, WALL-E goes to rescue the plant but is blasted into space. Before the pod self-destructs, WALL-E uses the emergency escape hatch and a fire extinguisher to exit the pod with the plant. A joyous EVE plays in space with WALL-E and even gives him an appreciative electric kiss.\\n\\nUsing the garbage chute, EVE and WALL-E sneak into McCrea\\'s cabin to give him the plant. But Auto (voice: MacInTalk), the ship\\'s auto pilot system, reveals it was the one who stole the plant earlier. It has no intention of allowing a return to Earth because of a centuries-old directive that was issued when the Earth was believed to be permanently uninhabitable. Auto blasts WALL-E, EVE and the plant back down the garbage chute and confines McCrea to his cabin. WALL-E and EVE barely escape being shot into space with the rest of the refuse but WALL-E is badly damaged. Meanwhile, McCrea has figured out how to hack into the ship\\'s communication system and tells EVE and WALL-E to head to the ship\\'s central deck, where a special machine will return the ship to earth when the plant is placed inside it. With the help of the robots they liberated earlier, WALL-E and EVE make it to the central deck where the special machine has risen from a platform. Auto tries to force the machine back into the platform but is prevented by WALL-E. McCrea manages to stand up on his own and shuts off AUTO. EVE puts the plant in the special machine and the Axiom is whisked back to Earth.\\n\\nWALL-E was grievously crushed in keeping Auto from collapsing the platform. Once they reach Earth, EVE rushes WALL-E back to his garage and repairs him. WALL-E doesn\\'t recognize her and begins to compact garbage. Distraught, EVE holds WALL-E\\'s hand and gives him an electric kiss again. This properly reboots WALL-E. McCrea teaches the other humans how to nurture the plant and heal the planet. It will be much easier than they think because just outside the city, plants have already begun to flourish.', 'When Shrek and Fiona come back from their honeymoon, they find an invitation to a royal ball with Fiona\\'s parents to celebrate their marriage, an event Shrek is reluctant to participate in. Fiona talks him into it, and along with Donkey, they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. They meet Fiona\\'s parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are surprised and repulsed by Fiona\\'s choice of husband (particularly the King himself), since they had arranged that Prince Charming rescue her from the castle but now they see that her husband is an ogre.\\n\\nAt a shared meal, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument over how Shrek and Fiona will raise their family, and Fiona, disgusted at Shrek and her father\\'s behaviour, locks herself away in her room that evening, where she meets her Fairy Godmother, who is also surprised at Fiona\\'s new looks. Shrek worries that he has lost his true love, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once infatuated with Prince Charming.\\n\\nKing Harold is accosted by the Fairy Godmother and Charming, her son. The two retell the Prince\\'s adventures and how he overcame many obstacles and climbed a high tower in order to rescue her finding instead a crossdressing wolf. They reprimand Harold for breaking an old promise that Charming would be able to marry Fiona and demand that he find a way to get rid of Shrek. Harold arranges for Shrek and Donkey to join him on a fictitious hunting trip, which really is a trap to lure the two into the hands of an assassin, Puss in Boots.\\n\\nWhen Fiona realizes that Shrek left she asks her father for help but he replies that he always wanted the best for her and that she should better think about what is the best for her, too. Puss is unable to defeat Shrek and, revealing that he was paid by Harold, asks to come along as a way to make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmother\\'s potion factory and steal a \"Happily Ever After\" potion that Shrek believes will restore Fiona\\'s love for him.\\n\\nShrek and Donkey both drink the potion and fall into a deep sleep. The potion also affects Fiona who also faints. Awakening the next morning, he sees three ladies taking care of him and is shocked to discover its effects: Shrek is now a handsome human, while Donkey has turned into a stallion. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight.\\n\\nHe, Donkey, and Puss return to the castle as Fiona awakens and sees her former, human self and she screams when she sees her reflection. However, the Fairy Godmother, having learned of the potion\\'s theft, intercepts Shrek and sends Charming to pose as him and win her love. Shrek watches from inside, and calls for her at the window. At the Fairy Godmother\\'s urging, Shrek leaves the castle, believing that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go.\\n\\nTo ensure that Fiona falls in love with Charming, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona\\'s tea. But Harold replies that it\\'s not possible to make his daughter fall in love in this way. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey, and Puss, who are soon arrested by the royal guards and thrown into a dungeon.\\n\\nWhile the royal ball begins, several of Shrek\\'s friends band together to free the trio and create a gigantic gingerbread man (whose name is Mongo), which breaks through the castle\\'s defenses so Shrek can stop Charming from kissing Fiona. He is too late to stop them; instead of falling in love with Charming, though, Fiona knocks him out with a headbutt. Harold reveals that he never gave Fiona the love potion, whereupon the Fairy Godmother attacks Shrek.\\n\\nThe now-enraged Fairy Godmother tries to kill Shrek with her magic wand, but Harold jumps in front of it; the spell ricochets off his armor and disintegrates her. With the Fairy Godmother gone, Harold reverts back into the Frog Prince. Harold apologizes, admitting to using the \"Happily Ever After\" potion years earlier to gain Lillian\\'s love, and approves Shrek and Fiona\\'s marriage. Lillian assures Harold that she still loves him.\\n\\nAs the clock strikes midnight, Fiona rejects Shrek\\'s offer to remain human, and revert back into ogres, while Donkey also returns to normal.\\n\\nIn a mid-credits scene: Dragon, who had previously married Donkey, reveals that they now have several dragon-donkey hybrid babies.', '\"Boggis and Bunce and Bean One short, one fat, one lean. These horrible crooks, so different in looks, were nonetheless equally mean.\" Mr. Fox (voice: George Clooney) and his wife Felicity Fox (voice: Meryl Streep) sneak into a henhouse to steal chickens. They\\'re caught in a cage on the way out because Mr. Fox sees the trap and can\\'t resist the temptation to spring it. As they hear someone coming, Mrs. Fox reveals that she\\'s pregnant and makes Mr. Fox promise that if they get away, he\\'ll give up raiding farms.\\n\\nCut to a few years later: the Foxes evidently escaped and now live underground with their slightly odd son, Ash (voice: Jason Schwartzman). Mr. Fox is working a safe job as a journalist. Against the advice of Badger (voice: Bill Murray), his attorney, he moves his family into a larger and finer home inside a tree on a hill. The treehouse has a good view of the nearby farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.\\n\\nAsh is immediately hostile when his cousin Kristofferson (voice: Eric Chase Anderson) joins the family for an extended visit because his father is sick. He makes the inoffensive Kristofferson sleep under a table in the bedroom they share. Ash feels threatened because his cousin appears to be good at everything. Kristofferson even succeeds at whackbat, a cricket-like game whose baroque rules are explained by Coach Skip (voice: Owen Wilson) -- though Kristofferson has never played it before. Meanwhile, Mr. Fox plots with Kiley (voice: Wallace Wolodarsky), the treehouse\\'s caretaker, to raid the Boggis, Bunce and Bean farms. They take Kristofferson but not Ash along on the raids, which deepens Ash\\'s resentment. Mr. Fox is careful to conceal these outings from Felicity, who nevertheless becomes suspicious when unexplained food appears in their larder. She warns Fox, \"if what I think is happening is happening -- it better not be.\"\\n\\nThe success of the raids leads the three angry farmers to set up a stakeout at the treehouse, where they shoot off Fox\\'s tail before the animals run back inside. The farmers try to dig them out, but the Foxes dig faster. Eventually they find their way into the sewers, where they join forces with many other animals made homeless by the farmers\\' destruction of their hill. These neighbors are none too pleased with Fox for bringing this revenge down on them all.\\n\\nMr. Fox, though penitent, is irrepressible; he marshals the animals, calling them by their Latin names and noting each one\\'s special talent. He organizes a tunneling project to burrow under all three farms and make away with all of Boggis\\'s chickens, all of Bunce\\'s ducks and geese, and all of Bean\\'s turkeys, apples, and cider. Ash and Kristofferson\\'s relationship, meanwhile, has begun to thaw after Kristofferson defends his cousin from a bully (Bully: \"Why\\'d you take your shoes off?\" Kristofferson: \"So I don\\'t break your nose when I kick it.\"). The two cousins slip away from the celebration that follows the megaraid; they aim to get Fox\\'s tail back from Bean. However, the closest they get to the tail is seeing it on TV -- Bean is wearing it as a necktie. Worse, Mrs. Bean catches Kristofferson, and Bean plans to use him to catch Mr. Fox.\\n\\nWhen they find that their goods have been stolen, the farmers decide to flood the animals\\' tunnel network by pumping it full of cider. The animals are forced to retreat into the sewers, and Fox learns that the farmers plan to use Kristofferson as bait to lure him into an ambush. They are soon confronted by Rat (voice: Willem Dafoe), Bean\\'s security guard. After a struggle with Fox that leaves him mortally wounded, Rat divulges that Kristofferson is being held in an attic on Bean\\'s farm.\\n\\nFox sends a message to the farmers, asking for a meeting in a town near the sewer hub. Fox offers to surrender in exchange for Kristofferson\\'s freedom. The farmers set up an ambush, but Fox and the others anticipate it and launch a counterattack. Fox, Ash, and Kylie escape the scene in the town and slip into Bean\\'s farm. A much matured Ash frees Kristofferson and impresses his father and the gang by braving enemy fire to release a rabid beagle that keeps the farmers at bay while the group escapes back to the sewers. On the way, they see a dark wolf on the hillside above the road. Fox has said he\\'s afraid of wolves, but he stops and tries to speak to this one in English and French. It doesn\\'t respond until Fox raises his fist in a gesture of solidarity. The wolf returns the gesture and departs into the woods.\\n\\nBy this time Ash and Kristofferson have settled their differences and become good friends, sharing meditation and other activities. Though the animals are still trapped in the sewers, Fox leads them to a drain in the floor of a large supermarket, which unbeknownst to them is owned by the three farmers. Celebrating their abundant new food source and the news that Felicity is pregnant again, the animals dance in the aisles.']\n"
